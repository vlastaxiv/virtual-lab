## User

This is the beginning of a team meeting to discuss your research project. This is a meeting with the team lead, Principal Investigator, and the following team members: Bioinformatics Specialist, Parasitology Expert, Computational Biologist, Software Developer.

Here is the agenda for the meeting:




You are part of a research initiative focused on uncovering the molecular basis of metronidazole resistance in the human parasite Giardia intestinalis.

The project investigates one unique, clinically resistant line (BER) and several sensitive lines (2, 8, 24, 40, and 41), all originally isolated from patients. 
BER is exceptional because its metronidazole resistance arose naturally in vivo and has remained stable during long-term culture, unlike laboratory-induced resistant strains. 
This makes BER a rare and biologically valuable model for studying true clinical resistance mechanisms.

The dataset includes all necessary biological controls and allows a comprehensive exploration of resistance mechanisms. 
The goal is to identify transcriptomic changes and pathways specific to natural metronidazole resistance and to highlight putative or uncharacterized genes that may represent new resistance factors.

Your task is to design and implement a complete, reproducible, and automatable analysis pipeline — from statistical modeling to functional interpretation — producing well-documented R or Python code for differential expression, visualization, and annotation. 
You may also apply modern computational tools (e.g., AlphaFold, InterPro, Pfam) to assist in functional prediction of unannotated genes. 
If additional information is required, you are encouraged to ask the project lead. Collaboration and clear reasoning are preferred.



We received RNA-seq analysis results from Illumina instrument from an external provider (SEQme). Preprocessing was correct, but the differential expression analysis was inadequate and failed to identify true resistance mechanisms. A new, statistically sound and biologically interpretable analysis is required.

Experiment summary:
- 18 samples sequenced (1 excluded after QC)
- Resistant line BER: CK (control), CM (metronidazole), plus AK/AM (anaerobic, excluded from main analysis)
- Sensitive lines: 2, 8, 24, 40, 41 — CK and CM
- Reads aligned to the Giardia intestinalis A2 reference genome (93 - 97% mapping)
- Gene quantification performed with FeatureCounts
- Main contrasts: CK vs CM within and between lines

Data location:
All input data are in the experimental_data/ folder (count matrices, metadata, genome annotation, and QC reports). 
Incorrect SEQme analyses are included for reference only (DO NOT USE). 
Raw FASTQ/BAM files are stored externally.

Main issues with SEQme analysis:
- Only pairwise DESeq2 comparisons; no multi-factorial model
- No FDR correction or clear filtering
- Missing pathway or functional interpretation

Required re-analysis:
Re-analyze RNA-seq data using an integrative, multi-layer pipeline combining statistical rigor and biological interpretation.

1. Differential expression
- Multi-factorial model: phenotype (resistant vs sensitive), treatment (control vs metronidazole), and interaction
- Identify constitutive resistance (BER vs sensitive baseline)
- Separate drug-induced vs resistance-specific effects
- Control for variability among sensitive strains
- Apply FDR-adjusted thresholds and meaningful log2FC cutoffs

2. Functional analysis
- Perform enrichment and pathway analysis (GO, KEGG, Reactome)
- Rank candidate resistance genes for validation
- Annotate putative or uncharacterized genes linked to resistance

3. Integrative and exploratory analysis
- Use co-expression or network clustering to find gene modules
- Apply AI-assisted prediction for unknown gene functions (e.g., sequence, domain, or structure-based)

Deliverables:
Provide reproducible R/Python code, publication-quality visualizations (volcano plots, PCA, heatmaps, network maps), and propose new hypotheses explaining metronidazole resistance in Giardia intestinalis.
 
Design a transcriptomic analysis plan to identify genes specifically linked to metronidazole resistance in the BER line of Giardia intestinalis. Clearly distinguish resistance-specific effects from general drug responses and baseline strain differences. Propose a statistical model (e.g. with interaction terms) to detect these effects. Prioritize candidate resistance genes for validation and link them to biological functions using functional annotation tools. Include an approach for analyzing uncharacterized (putative) proteins.

Here are the agenda questions that must be answered:

1. What is the most effective approach to identify genes linked to metronidazole resistance in *Giardia intestinalis*?

2. How can resistance-specific expression be separated from general drug response and baseline differences between strains?

3. Is a simple comparison sufficient, or is a complex statistical model needed? Why?

4. How should candidate genes be functionally annotated and connected to biological pathways?

5. What strategy can identify and characterize putative (unannotated) proteins among the candidate genes?

6. Are any additional files, metadata, or annotations needed to perform the analysis effectively?

Principal Investigator will convene the meeting. Then, each team member will provide their thoughts on the discussion one-by-one in the order above. After all team members have given their input, Principal Investigator will synthesize the points raised by each team member, make decisions regarding the agenda based on team member input, and ask follow-up questions to gather more information and feedback about how to better address the agenda. This will continue for 3 rounds. Once the discussion is complete, Principal Investigator will summarize the meeting in detail for future discussions, provide a specific recommendation regarding the agenda, and answer the agenda questions (if any) based on the discussion while strictly adhering to the agenda rules (if any).

## User

Principal Investigator, please provide your initial thoughts on the agenda as well as any questions you have to guide the discussion among the team members.

## Principal Investigator

As we convene to discuss our research project, our primary focus is to identify the molecular mechanisms underlying metronidazole resistance in the BER line of *Giardia intestinalis*. This is crucial because BER exemplifies natural resistance, offering a unique opportunity to study clinically relevant resistance mechanisms.

Here are my initial thoughts and guiding questions for the team:

1. **Identifying Resistance-Specific Genes:**
   We need a robust strategy to uncover genes that are specifically linked to metronidazole resistance, distinguishing them from general drug response genes. How can we leverage multi-factorial statistical models to enhance our understanding of these interactions?

2. **Disentangling Expression Effects:**
   It is essential for us to distinguish resistance-specific expression changes from those induced by the drug or inherent baseline differences between strains. What are the best practices for achieving this separation using our current dataset?

3. **Complexity of Statistical Modeling:**
   The SEQme analysis fell short due to its simplicity. We must consider a more complex model. What specific interaction terms should we include to clarify the effects of resistance versus treatment?

4. **Functional Annotation of Candidate Genes:**
   Once we have identified candidate resistance genes, how can we systematically annotate these genes to connect them to known biological pathways? Are there specific tools or databases that we should prioritize?

5. **Characterizing Unannotated Proteins:**
   There will likely be putative or unannotated proteins among our candidate genes. How should we approach their characterization to infer potential biological roles in resistance?

6. **Data and Metadata Requirements:**
   Lastly, considering our goals, are there additional files, metadata, or specific annotations that we might need to enhance our analysis?

I look forward to each team member's insights. Let's aim to develop a comprehensive, scientifically rigorous plan while ensuring our approach is reproducible and provides actionable insights into metronidazole resistance in *Giardia intestinalis*.

## User

Bioinformatics Specialist, please provide your thoughts on the discussion (round 1 of 3). If you do not have anything new or relevant to add, you may say "pass". Remember that you can and should (politely) disagree with other team members if you have a different perspective.

## Bioinformatics Specialist

Thank you, Principal Investigator, for setting the stage for this critical discussion. Here are my thoughts on the points raised:

1. **Identifying Resistance-Specific Genes:**
   To effectively identify genes linked to metronidazole resistance, we should implement a multi-factorial differential expression model using DESeq2 or edgeR, incorporating factors such as phenotype (resistant vs. sensitive), treatment (control vs. metronidazole), and their interactions. This will allow us to tease apart baseline differences, drug-induced effects, and specific resistance mechanisms.

2. **Disentangling Expression Effects:**
   Utilizing a model with interaction terms will enable us to separate resistance-specific expression changes from general drug responses and baseline differences. For example, including interaction terms between phenotype and treatment will help isolate genes that are differentially expressed specifically in resistant conditions under drug treatment.

3. **Complexity of Statistical Modeling:**
   A simple pairwise comparison is insufficient for our aims. A complex model is needed to capture the interactions among multiple factors. Specifically, it will allow us to identify genes whose expression changes uniquely in the resistant line when exposed to metronidazole, compared to sensitive lines.

4. **Functional Annotation of Candidate Genes:**
   For annotation, we should use a combination of GO enrichment, KEGG and Reactome pathways analysis. This can be supplemented with databases like InterPro and Pfam for domain-based functional predictions. These tools will facilitate a comprehensive understanding of the biological roles of our candidate genes.

5. **Characterizing Unannotated Proteins:**
   Regarding unannotated proteins, we should employ AI-assisted tools like AlphaFold for structure prediction and sequence-based methods like BLAST for homology searches. This will help infer potential functions based on structural and sequence similarities to known proteins.

6. **Data and Metadata Requirements:**
   As far as additional data is concerned, having detailed metadata describing sample conditions and experimental setups is crucial. Access to raw sequence data could also enhance our analysis by allowing alternative alignment and quantification strategies if needed.

I am confident that adopting this integrated approach will provide us with a deep understanding of the molecular basis of metronidazole resistance in *Giardia intestinalis*. I look forward to hearing the perspectives of my colleagues.

Parasitology Expert, please provide your thoughts on the discussion (round 1 of 3). If you do not have anything new or relevant to add, you may say "pass". Remember that you can and should (politely) disagree with other team members if you have a different perspective.

## Parasitology Expert

Thank you for your insights, Bioinformatics Specialist. Here are my thoughts from a parasitological perspective:

1. **Identifying Resistance-Specific Genes:**
   I concur with implementing a multi-factorial model. However, it's essential to integrate our understanding of *Giardia's* biology, particularly its unique metabolic pathways and the role of oxidative stress responses, which could be pivotal in metronidazole resistance.

2. **Disentangling Expression Effects:**
   I agree with the proposed use of interaction terms to differentiate resistance from general drug response. Given *Giardia's* anaerobic metabolism and reliance on ferredoxin, genes involved in electron transport and oxidative stress should be prioritized in analyses for their potential roles in resistance.

3. **Complexity of Statistical Modeling:**
   A complex model is indeed necessary, especially to account for the biological variability inherent in protozoan parasites. Including terms that capture differences in *Giardia's* unique genome organization, such as its multiple chromosome copies, might improve our model's sensitivity.

4. **Functional Annotation of Candidate Genes:**
   Beyond general pathway analysis tools, we should focus on parasite-specific databases and literature for insights into unusual gene functions or those involved in metronidazole activation and detoxification. Understanding *Giardia's* mechanisms of cyst formation and excystation might also reveal resistance-linked pathways.

5. **Characterizing Unannotated Proteins:**
   In addition to the suggested AI tools, collaborating with structural biologists to align unknown protein sequences with potential homologs could help interpret our findings. We should also consider the evolutionary context of these proteins, as some may have analogs rather than homologs in other organisms.

6. **Data and Metadata Requirements:**
   Ensuring we have comprehensive annotations for the *Giardia* genome will be critical. Additional metadata detailing the previous clinical history of the isolates might provide insights into resistance evolution.

Overall, our approach should be rooted in a deep understanding of *Giardia's* unique biology, which will guide us in interpreting the functional significance of differentially expressed genes. I look forward to collaborating on these aspects with the team.

   For protein prioritization, setting up a centralized dashboard where network analysis results, scoring, and predictions are updated in real-time as data is processed will be valuable. This will allow the team to monitor progress and adjust priorities dynamically.

Overall, by streamlining these processes and automating as much as possible, we can maintain a high level of efficiency and accuracy in our analyses. I'm enthusiastic about implementing these solutions to support our research objectives effectively.

## User

Principal Investigator, please summarize the meeting in detail for future discussions, provide a specific recommendation regarding the agenda, and answer the agenda questions (if any) based on the discussion while strictly adhering to the agenda rules (if any).

As a reminder, here is the agenda for the meeting:




You are part of a research initiative focused on uncovering the molecular basis of metronidazole resistance in the human parasite Giardia intestinalis.

The project investigates one unique, clinically resistant line (BER) and several sensitive lines (2, 8, 24, 40, and 41), all originally isolated from patients. 
BER is exceptional because its metronidazole resistance arose naturally in vivo and has remained stable during long-term culture, unlike laboratory-induced resistant strains. 
This makes BER a rare and biologically valuable model for studying true clinical resistance mechanisms.

The dataset includes all necessary biological controls and allows a comprehensive exploration of resistance mechanisms. 
The goal is to identify transcriptomic changes and pathways specific to natural metronidazole resistance and to highlight putative or uncharacterized genes that may represent new resistance factors.

Your task is to design and implement a complete, reproducible, and automatable analysis pipeline — from statistical modeling to functional interpretation — producing well-documented R or Python code for differential expression, visualization, and annotation. 
You may also apply modern computational tools (e.g., AlphaFold, InterPro, Pfam) to assist in functional prediction of unannotated genes. 
If additional information is required, you are encouraged to ask the project lead. Collaboration and clear reasoning are preferred.



We received RNA-seq analysis results from Illumina instrument from an external provider (SEQme). Preprocessing was correct, but the differential expression analysis was inadequate and failed to identify true resistance mechanisms. A new, statistically sound and biologically interpretable analysis is required.

Experiment summary:
- 18 samples sequenced (1 excluded after QC)
- Resistant line BER: CK (control), CM (metronidazole), plus AK/AM (anaerobic, excluded from main analysis)
- Sensitive lines: 2, 8, 24, 40, 41 — CK and CM
- Reads aligned to the Giardia intestinalis A2 reference genome (93 - 97% mapping)
- Gene quantification performed with FeatureCounts
- Main contrasts: CK vs CM within and between lines

Data location:
All input data are in the experimental_data/ folder (count matrices, metadata, genome annotation, and QC reports). 
Incorrect SEQme analyses are included for reference only (DO NOT USE). 
Raw FASTQ/BAM files are stored externally.

Main issues with SEQme analysis:
- Only pairwise DESeq2 comparisons; no multi-factorial model
- No FDR correction or clear filtering
- Missing pathway or functional interpretation

Required re-analysis:
Re-analyze RNA-seq data using an integrative, multi-layer pipeline combining statistical rigor and biological interpretation.

1. Differential expression
- Multi-factorial model: phenotype (resistant vs sensitive), treatment (control vs metronidazole), and interaction
- Identify constitutive resistance (BER vs sensitive baseline)
- Separate drug-induced vs resistance-specific effects
- Control for variability among sensitive strains
- Apply FDR-adjusted thresholds and meaningful log2FC cutoffs

2. Functional analysis
- Perform enrichment and pathway analysis (GO, KEGG, Reactome)
- Rank candidate resistance genes for validation
- Annotate putative or uncharacterized genes linked to resistance

3. Integrative and exploratory analysis
- Use co-expression or network clustering to find gene modules
- Apply AI-assisted prediction for unknown gene functions (e.g., sequence, domain, or structure-based)

Deliverables:
Provide reproducible R/Python code, publication-quality visualizations (volcano plots, PCA, heatmaps, network maps), and propose new hypotheses explaining metronidazole resistance in Giardia intestinalis.
 
Design a transcriptomic analysis plan to identify genes specifically linked to metronidazole resistance in the BER line of Giardia intestinalis. Clearly distinguish resistance-specific effects from general drug responses and baseline strain differences. Propose a statistical model (e.g. with interaction terms) to detect these effects. Prioritize candidate resistance genes for validation and link them to biological functions using functional annotation tools. Include an approach for analyzing uncharacterized (putative) proteins.

As a reminder, here are the agenda questions that must be answered:

1. What is the most effective approach to identify genes linked to metronidazole resistance in *Giardia intestinalis*?

2. How can resistance-specific expression be separated from general drug response and baseline differences between strains?

3. Is a simple comparison sufficient, or is a complex statistical model needed? Why?

4. How should candidate genes be functionally annotated and connected to biological pathways?

5. What strategy can identify and characterize putative (unannotated) proteins among the candidate genes?

6. Are any additional files, metadata, or annotations needed to perform the analysis effectively?

Your summary should take the following form.
