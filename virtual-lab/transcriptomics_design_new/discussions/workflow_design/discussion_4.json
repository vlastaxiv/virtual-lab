        "message": "This is the beginning of an individual meeting with Principal Investigator to discuss your research project.\n\nHere is the agenda for the meeting:\n\n\n\nYou are working on a transcriptomic research project to identify genes associated with metronidazole resistance in the human parasite Giardia intestinalis.\n\nYou have a unique resistant line named BER, derived from a human patient, which has maintained stable resistance for years in culture. You also have five sensitive lines: isolates 2, 8, 40, 41, and 24.\n\nFor each isolate (both resistant BER and sensitive lines), you have RNA-seq data from control samples (without metronidazole) and from treated samples (with the same metronidazole concentration), all cultured under identical microaerobic conditions.\n\nThe goal is to identify the true molecular mechanisms of metronidazole resistance and distinguish them from general drug responses and baseline strain differences.\n\n\n\nWe received RNA-seq data analysis from an external sequencing company (SEQme). While the preprocessing and basic analysis were performed correctly, the differential expression analysis has significant limitations that prevent proper identification of resistance mechanisms.\n\nSequencing and Preprocessing (COMPLETED):\n- 18 samples successfully sequenced (one sample excluded during QC)\n- Resistant line BER: 6 samples (3 control CK, 3 metronidazole-treated CM)\n- Sensitive lines (2, 8, 24, 40, 41): 12 samples (controls and treated for each line)\n- PE150 sequencing, 57-80M reads per sample\n- Reads aligned to Giardia intestinalis reference genome A2 (93-97% mapping rate)\n- Gene quantification performed with FeatureCounts\n- Data quality is good (RIN ~9.5-10 for most samples)\n\nTheir Differential Expression Analysis and Problems:\n\nWhat they did:\n- Used DESeq2 for simple pairwise comparisons (e.g., BERCK vs CK, CK vs CM, etc.)\n- Applied criteria: log2FC \u2265 1 or \u2264 -1, p-value < 0.05 (unadjusted)\n- Filtering: minimum 1 CPM within at least 2 replicates (exact implementation unclear)\n- Generated basic visualizations: volcano plots, MA plots, and heatmaps for selected genes\n\nMajor Problems:\n\n1. Inadequate Statistical Approach:\n   - Simple pairwise comparisons cannot distinguish resistance mechanisms from baseline strain differences\n   - No multi-factorial model to account for genotype vs. treatment interaction\n   - Cannot separate constitutive resistance effects from drug-induced responses\n   - Cannot account for natural variation among sensitive strains\n\n2. Inappropriate Statistical Thresholds:\n   - Used unadjusted p-values (< 0.05) instead of FDR-adjusted p-values\n   - High risk of false positives due to multiple testing problem\n   - log2FC cutoff of \u00b11 may not be stringent enough for biological significance\n\n3. Unclear Filtering Criteria:\n   - \"Minimum 1 CPM within at least 2 replicates\" is ambiguous\n   - Not clear how many genes were filtered out before analysis\n   - Pre-filtering strategy not well documented\n\n4. Missing Biological Interpretation:\n   - No pathway enrichment analysis (KEGG, GO, Reactome)\n   - No functional annotation of differentially expressed genes\n   - No Gene Ontology term enrichment\n   - Only basic visualizations without biological context\n\n5. No Strategy for Resistance Mechanism Identification:\n   - Did not define contrasts to isolate resistance-specific genes\n   - Cannot distinguish between:\n     * True constitutive resistance mechanisms (unique to BER)\n     * Baseline transcriptomic differences between strains (unrelated to resistance)\n     * General cellular response to metronidazole (present in all lines)\n\n6. Missing Validation Strategy:\n   - No ranked list of candidate resistance genes provided\n   - No prioritization based on biological function or pathway involvement\n   - No clear guidance for experimental validation\n\nWhat We Need:\nA proper re-analysis that:\n- Uses a multi-factorial design to model genotype (resistant vs sensitive), treatment (control vs metronidazole), and their interaction\n- Identifies genes specifically associated with constitutive resistance (differential in BER vs sensitive lines at baseline)\n- Separates drug response effects (treatment-induced changes) from resistance mechanisms\n- Accounts for strain-to-strain variation among the sensitive lines\n- Uses appropriate statistical thresholds (adjusted p-values, appropriate log2FC cutoffs)\n- Includes functional enrichment analysis to identify biological pathways involved in resistance\n- Provides a ranked list of candidate resistance genes for experimental validation\n\nAVAILABLE DATA FILES in experimental_data/ folder:\n\nEssential files for re-analysis:\n- A2_count_matrix.txt - raw gene count matrix from FeatureCounts (all 18 samples)\n- raw_counts_matrix_forDEseq2_prednorm.csv - alternative format count matrix\n- sample_metadata_forDEseq2_prednorm.csv - sample metadata (strain, treatment)\n- exp-design.txt - experimental design information\n- Counts_with_geneNames.txt - count matrix with gene names\n- genome_annotation/ - Giardia intestinalis A2 genome annotation files\n\nQuality control reports:\n- 242114199_multiqc_report.html - comprehensive QC report (FastQC, alignment stats)\n- SEQme-NGS_report-Order_no_242114199.pdf - full analysis report from SEQme\n- DGE4199_stats.xlsx - statistics summary\n- PCA_top500_log2_autoscale_colored_labels.png - PCA visualization\n\nTheir problematic analysis results (for reference only - DO NOT USE):\n- SEQme_DGE_results/ - folder containing all their pairwise DESeq2 comparisons\n  * These results are fundamentally flawed due to inappropriate statistical approach\n  * Provided for reference only to understand what NOT to do\n  * The raw count matrix should be re-analyzed properly with multi-factorial design\n\nNote: Raw sequencing data (FASTQ, BAM files) are available on external storage if needed for quality validation.\n\n\nBased on the project specification, selected tools, and implementation assignments, design a detailed step-by-step workflow for the transcriptomics analysis.\n\nThe workflow should cover:\n1. Data preparation and quality control\n2. Statistical analysis (DESeq2 multi-factorial model)\n3. Functional annotation (pathway enrichment)\n4. Putative protein characterization\n5. Visualization and reporting\n\nProvide a clear, modular, and reproducible workflow with inputs, outputs, and quality checks for each step.\n\n\nHere are the agenda questions that must be answered:\n\n1. What is the complete step-by-step workflow for the analysis?\n\n2. What are the inputs and outputs for each major step?\n\n3. What quality control checks should be performed at each stage?\n\n4. How will the different analysis components integrate together?\n\n5. What are the key decision points and how should they be handled?\n\nPrincipal Investigator, please provide your response to the agenda."
