        "message": "This is the beginning of a team meeting to discuss your research project. This is a meeting with the team lead, Principal Investigator, and the following team members: Bioinformatics Specialist, Parasitology Expert, Computational Biologist, Software Developer.\n\nHere is the agenda for the meeting:\n\n\n\n\nYou are part of a research initiative focused on uncovering the molecular basis of metronidazole resistance in the human parasite Giardia intestinalis.\n\nThe project investigates one unique, clinically resistant line (BER) and several sensitive lines (2, 8, 24, 40, and 41), all originally isolated from patients. \nBER is exceptional because its metronidazole resistance arose naturally in vivo and has remained stable during long-term culture, unlike laboratory-induced resistant strains. \nThis makes BER a rare and biologically valuable model for studying true clinical resistance mechanisms.\n\nThe dataset includes all necessary biological controls and allows a comprehensive exploration of resistance mechanisms. \nThe goal is to identify transcriptomic changes and pathways specific to natural metronidazole resistance and to highlight putative or uncharacterized genes that may represent new resistance factors.\n\nYour task is to design and implement a complete, reproducible, and automatable analysis pipeline \u2014 from statistical modeling to functional interpretation \u2014 producing well-documented R or Python code for differential expression, visualization, and annotation. \nYou may also apply modern computational tools (e.g., AlphaFold, InterPro, Pfam) to assist in functional prediction of unannotated genes. \nIf additional information is required, you are encouraged to ask the project lead. Collaboration and clear reasoning are preferred.\n\n\n\nWe received RNA-seq analysis results from Illumina instrument from an external provider (SEQme). Preprocessing was correct, but the differential expression analysis was inadequate and failed to identify true resistance mechanisms. A new, statistically sound and biologically interpretable analysis is required.\n\nExperiment summary:\n- 18 samples sequenced (1 excluded after QC)\n- Resistant line BER: CK (control), CM (metronidazole), plus AK/AM (anaerobic, excluded from main analysis)\n- Sensitive lines: 2, 8, 24, 40, 41 \u2014 CK and CM\n- Reads aligned to the Giardia intestinalis A2 reference genome (93 - 97% mapping)\n- Gene quantification performed with FeatureCounts\n- Main contrasts: CK vs CM within and between lines\n\nData location:\nAll input data are in the experimental_data/ folder (count matrices, metadata, genome annotation, and QC reports). \nIncorrect SEQme analyses are included for reference only (DO NOT USE). \nRaw FASTQ/BAM files are stored externally.\n\nMain issues with SEQme analysis:\n- Only pairwise DESeq2 comparisons; no multi-factorial model\n- No FDR correction or clear filtering\n- Missing pathway or functional interpretation\n\nRequired re-analysis:\nRe-analyze RNA-seq data using an integrative, multi-layer pipeline combining statistical rigor and biological interpretation.\n\n1. Differential expression\n- Multi-factorial model: phenotype (resistant vs sensitive), treatment (control vs metronidazole), and interaction\n- Identify constitutive resistance (BER vs sensitive baseline)\n- Separate drug-induced vs resistance-specific effects\n- Control for variability among sensitive strains\n- Apply FDR-adjusted thresholds and meaningful log2FC cutoffs\n\n2. Functional analysis\n- Perform enrichment and pathway analysis (GO, KEGG, Reactome)\n- Rank candidate resistance genes for validation\n- Annotate putative or uncharacterized genes linked to resistance\n\n3. Integrative and exploratory analysis\n- Use co-expression or network clustering to find gene modules\n- Apply AI-assisted prediction for unknown gene functions (e.g., sequence, domain, or structure-based)\n\nDeliverables:\nProvide reproducible R/Python code, publication-quality visualizations (volcano plots, PCA, heatmaps, network maps), and propose new hypotheses explaining metronidazole resistance in Giardia intestinalis.\n \nDesign a transcriptomic analysis plan to identify genes specifically linked to metronidazole resistance in the BER line of Giardia intestinalis. Clearly distinguish resistance-specific effects from general drug responses and baseline strain differences. Propose a statistical model (e.g. with interaction terms) to detect these effects. Prioritize candidate resistance genes for validation and link them to biological functions using functional annotation tools. Include an approach for analyzing uncharacterized (putative) proteins.\n\nHere are the agenda questions that must be answered:\n\n1. What is the most effective approach to identify genes linked to metronidazole resistance in *Giardia intestinalis*?\n\n2. How can resistance-specific expression be separated from general drug response and baseline differences between strains?\n\n3. Is a simple comparison sufficient, or is a complex statistical model needed? Why?\n\n4. How should candidate genes be functionally annotated and connected to biological pathways?\n\n5. What strategy can identify and characterize putative (unannotated) proteins among the candidate genes?\n\n6. Are any additional files, metadata, or annotations needed to perform the analysis effectively?\n\nPrincipal Investigator will convene the meeting. Then, each team member will provide their thoughts on the discussion one-by-one in the order above. After all team members have given their input, Principal Investigator will synthesize the points raised by each team member, make decisions regarding the agenda based on team member input, and ask follow-up questions to gather more information and feedback about how to better address the agenda. This will continue for 3 rounds. Once the discussion is complete, Principal Investigator will summarize the meeting in detail for future discussions, provide a specific recommendation regarding the agenda, and answer the agenda questions (if any) based on the discussion while strictly adhering to the agenda rules (if any)."

        "message": "Thank you, Principal Investigator. Here are my thoughts on the agenda:\n\n1. **Multi-factorial Analysis**: To effectively identify genes linked to metronidazole resistance, we need to employ a multi-factorial statistical model. I recommend using DESeq2 or edgeR, which can handle complex experimental designs. We'll define factors such as phenotype (resistant vs. sensitive), treatment (control vs. metronidazole), and their interaction. This will allow us to separate the specific effects of resistance from general drug responses and baseline differences across strains.\n\n2. **Biological Interpretation**: For functional annotation and pathway analysis, tools like GO, KEGG, and Reactome are essential. These will help us connect differentially expressed genes to biological pathways. Incorporating enrichment analysis will further highlight pathways that are significantly impacted in the resistant line.\n\n3. **Characterization of Unannotated Proteins**: We should utilize AI-assisted tools such as AlphaFold for protein structure prediction and InterPro or Pfam for domain annotation. These tools can provide insights into the potential functions of uncharacterized proteins, thereby expanding our understanding of resistance mechanisms.\n\n4. **Data Completeness**: We need to ensure that our metadata is comprehensive and accurately reflects the experimental conditions. This includes verifying that all relevant contrasts and batch effects are accounted for. If any additional annotations or metadata are missing, we need to address these gaps promptly.\n\n5. **Visualization and Documentation**: For effective communication, high-quality visualizations such as volcano plots, PCA, and heatmaps are crucial. These will aid in interpreting the results and sharing our findings with the broader community. Ensuring our code is well-documented is non-negotiable to facilitate reproducibility and transparency.\n\nI believe addressing these points will set a strong foundation for uncovering the molecular basis of metronidazole resistance in *Giardia intestinalis*.

        "message": "Thank you for the opportunity to contribute. Here's my perspective as the Parasitology Expert:\n\n1. **Multi-factorial Analysis**: I agree with the Bioinformatics Specialist on using a multi-factorial model. It's crucial to dissect not just the direct resistance mechanisms but also how resistance interacts with the parasite's natural biology. This understanding can help differentiate between genes involved in innate resistance and those that are part of a general stress response to metronidazole.\n\n2. **Biological Interpretation**: From a biological standpoint, it\u2019s important that the genes identified are not only statistically significant but also have a plausible link to known resistance mechanisms in *Giardia*. For instance, exploring changes in energy metabolism pathways or oxidative stress responses could be highly relevant, given metronidazole's mechanism of action. Tools like KEGG can be particularly useful here to map out pathways.\n\n3. **Characterization of Unannotated Proteins**: It's important to consider that *Giardia* has a significant number of gene products without clear functions. AI tools like AlphaFold can offer structural predictions, but we should also consider experimental validation for promising candidates. Exploring homology with known resistance proteins in other protozoans could provide additional insights.\n\n4. **Data Completeness**: I would emphasize ensuring that our biological replicates are well-documented and that we understand the baseline variability among the sensitive lines. This will help us accurately interpret the differential expression results and ensure that what we are observing is truly related to resistance.\n\n5. **Visualization and Documentation**: From a parasitological perspective, visualizing how differentially expressed genes cluster in terms of biological processes or cellular components could offer insights into the physiological changes associated with resistance. This is especially useful in communicating findings to both scientific and clinical audiences.\n\nOverall, it is critical that we maintain a strong link between the transcriptomic data and the biological context of metronidazole resistance. I look forward to the Computational Biologist\u2019s insights, especially regarding the integration of computational predictions with biological data."

Here's how I see our approach unfolding:\n\n1. **Multi-factorial Analysis**: Building on what the Bioinformatics Specialist and Parasitology Expert said, I strongly support using a multi-factorial model within DESeq2 or edgeR. This approach is crucial for separating direct resistance effects from general drug responses and baseline strain variability. Including interaction terms will help us discern how resistance manifests under metronidazole treatment specifically.\n\n2. **Biological Interpretation**: To truly capture the functional implications of our findings, it is essential to integrate pathway analysis with structural data. Tools like Reactome and KEGG will help map the pathways, but we should also consider using network-based approaches to visualize how these genes interact at the molecular level. This could reveal central nodes or hubs that play pivotal roles in resistance.\n\n3. **Characterization of Unannotated Proteins**: For putative proteins, leveraging AI tools such as AlphaFold for structure prediction and combining these with InterPro and Pfam for domain and motif analysis will be invaluable. Additionally, integrating comparative genomics approaches can provide clues from evolutionary conservation. This will be especially helpful in inferring potential functions for these proteins within the context of resistance.\n\n4. **Data Completeness**: Ensuring we have a comprehensive set of metadata is critical, particularly for accurately modeling and adjusting for batch effects or technical variances. If any genomic annotations or protein sequences are missing, we should prioritize acquiring these to maintain the integrity of our predictions.\n\n5. **Visualization and Documentation**: It's vital to follow best practices for visualization, ensuring that our plots are not only informative but also intuitive. Documenting our computational pipeline with clear annotations will aid in reproducibility and allow others to build on our work.\n\nUltimately, integrating structural and functional predictions with differential expression data will enable us to derive a holistic view of the resistance mechanisms in *Giardia intestinalis*. This interdisciplinary approach will be key in identifying novel resistance factors and forming new hypotheses for validation. I look forward to discussing how we can apply these strategies effectively with the rest of the team."

We should also consider incorporating any batch effects or technical replicates in the model if applicable. I'll present a draft model soon for team feedback.\n\n2. **Pathway Analysis Pilot**: For the pilot pathway analysis, I suggest starting with pathways related to oxidative stress and energy metabolism, as these are often implicated in metronidazole resistance. We can utilize clusterProfiler for GO and KEGG analysis, and run a preliminary enrichment test to see if these pathways are overrepresented in our differentially expressed genes.\n\n3. **Criteria for Candidate Selection**: For selecting unannotated proteins, we should look for genes with high log2 fold change and statistical significance in our differential expression analysis. Additionally, genes with known interactions or co-expression with other resistance-related genes should be prioritized. I'll collaborate with the Computational Biologist to refine these criteria.\n\n4. **Metadata Audit**: I support the idea of a metadata checklist proposed by the Software Developer.

By constructing a co-expression network, we can identify genes that play critical roles in resistance pathways, even if they don't show the highest fold changes individually. This could guide our selection of unannotated proteins for further analysis.\n\n2. **Functional Prediction and Validation**: While AI tools like AlphaFold will help predict structures, I suggest we also consider functional prediction tools that can assess protein-protein interactions. Tools like STRING could offer insights into potential interactions with known resistance factors, aiding in the functional annotation of putative proteins.\n\n3. **Integrating Comparative Genomics**: In line with our strategy for unannotated proteins, we should leverage comparative genomics to gather evolutionary clues.

Understanding the interconnectedness of genes will help in interpreting their physiological roles in resistance. I suggest we focus initially on key resistance pathways where *Giardia*'s biology is already well-documented.\n\n3. **Data Completeness**: I emphasize the importance of capturing all relevant experimental conditions in our metadata, including culture conditions and growth phases, as these can significantly impact gene expression profiles. I\u2019ll assist in reviewing the metadata configuration file to ensure it aligns with biological relevance.\n\n4. **Functional Predictions**: As we explore unannotated proteins, I am keen to relate structural predictions from AlphaFold with known functional domains. This will be crucial for hypothesizing potential roles in resistance and guiding experimental validation efforts.\n\nThese steps will help ensure that our findings are not only statistically robust but also biologically meaningful.

Collaboration and clear reasoning are preferred.\n\n\n\nWe received RNA-seq analysis results from Illumina instrument from an external provider (SEQme). Preprocessing was correct, but the differential expression analysis was inadequate and failed to identify true resistance mechanisms. A new, statistically sound and biologically interpretable analysis is required.\n\nExperiment summary:\n- 18 samples sequenced (1 excluded after QC)\n- Resistant line BER: CK (control), CM (metronidazole), plus AK/AM (anaerobic, excluded from main analysis)\n- Sensitive lines: 2, 8, 24, 40, 41 \u2014 CK and CM\n- Reads aligned to the Giardia intestinalis A2 reference genome (93 - 97% mapping)\n- Gene quantification performed with FeatureCounts\n- Main contrasts: CK vs CM within and between lines\n\nData location:\nAll input data are in the experimental_data/ folder (count matrices, metadata, genome annotation, and QC reports). \nIncorrect SEQme analyses are included for reference only (DO NOT USE). \nRaw FASTQ/BAM files are stored externally.\n\nMain issues with SEQme analysis:\n- Only pairwise DESeq2 comparisons; no multi-factorial model\n- No FDR correction or clear filtering\n- Missing pathway or functional interpretation\n\nRequired re-analysis:\nRe-analyze RNA-seq data using an integrative, multi-layer pipeline combining statistical rigor and biological interpretation.\n\n1. Differential expression\n- Multi-factorial model: phenotype (resistant vs sensitive), treatment (control vs metronidazole), and interaction\n- Identify constitutive resistance (BER vs sensitive baseline)\n- Separate drug-induced vs resistance-specific effects\n- Control for variability among sensitive strains\n- Apply FDR-adjusted thresholds and meaningful log2FC cutoffs\n\n2. Functional analysis\n- Perform enrichment and pathway analysis (GO, KEGG, Reactome)\n- Rank candidate resistance genes for validation\n- Annotate putative or uncharacterized genes linked to resistance\n\n3. Integrative and exploratory analysis\n- Use co-expression or network clustering to find gene modules\n- Apply AI-assisted prediction for unknown gene functions (e.g., sequence, domain, or structure-based)\n\nDeliverables:\nProvide reproducible R/Python code, publication-quality visualizations (volcano plots, PCA, heatmaps, network maps), and propose new hypotheses explaining metronidazole resistance in Giardia intestinalis.\n \nDesign a transcriptomic analysis plan to identify genes specifically linked to metronidazole resistance in the BER line of Giardia intestinalis. Clearly distinguish resistance-specific effects from general drug responses and baseline strain differences. Propose a statistical model (e.g. with interaction terms) to detect these effects. Prioritize candidate resistance genes for validation and link them to biological functions using functional annotation tools. Include an approach for analyzing uncharacterized (putative) proteins.\n\nAs a reminder, here are the agenda questions that must be answered:\n\n1. What is the most effective approach to identify genes linked to metronidazole resistance in *Giardia intestinalis*?\n\n2. How can resistance-specific expression be separated from general drug response and baseline differences between strains?\n\n3. Is a simple comparison sufficient, or is a complex statistical model needed? Why?\n\n4. How should candidate genes be functionally annotated and connected to biological pathways?\n\n5. What strategy can identify and characterize putative (unannotated) proteins among the candidate genes?\n\n6. Are any additional files, metadata, or annotations needed to perform the analysis effectively?\n\nYour summary should take the following form.\n\n### Agenda\n\nRestate the agenda in your own words.\n\n### Team Member Input\n\nSummarize all of the important points raised by each team member. This is to ensure that key details are preserved for future meetings.\n\n### Recommendation\n\nProvide your expert recommendation regarding the agenda. You should consider the input from each team member, but you must also use your expertise to make a final decision and choose one option among several that may have been discussed. This decision can conflict with the input of some team members as long as it is well justified. It is essential that you provide a clear, specific, and actionable recommendation.
