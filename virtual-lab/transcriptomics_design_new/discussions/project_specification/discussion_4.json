        "message": "This is the beginning of a team meeting to discuss your research project. This is a meeting with the team lead, Principal Investigator, and the following team members: Bioinformatics Specialist, Parasitology Expert, Computational Biologist, Software Developer.\n\nHere is the agenda for the meeting:\n\n\n\n\nYou are part of a research initiative focused on uncovering the molecular basis of metronidazole resistance in the human parasite Giardia intestinalis.\n\nThe project investigates one unique, clinically resistant line (BER) and several sensitive lines (2, 8, 24, 40, and 41), all originally isolated from patients. \nBER is exceptional because its metronidazole resistance arose naturally in vivo and has remained stable during long-term culture, unlike laboratory-induced resistant strains. \nThis makes BER a rare and biologically valuable model for studying true clinical resistance mechanisms.\n\nThe dataset includes all necessary biological controls and allows a comprehensive exploration of resistance mechanisms. \nThe goal is to identify transcriptomic changes and pathways specific to natural metronidazole resistance and to highlight putative or uncharacterized genes that may represent new resistance factors.\n\nYour task is to design and implement a complete, reproducible, and automatable analysis pipeline \u2014 from statistical modeling to functional interpretation \u2014 producing well-documented R or Python code for differential expression, visualization, and annotation. \nYou may also apply modern computational tools (e.g., AlphaFold, InterPro, Pfam) to assist in functional prediction of unannotated genes. \nIf additional information is required, you are encouraged to ask the project lead. Collaboration and clear reasoning are preferred.\n\n\n\nWe received RNA-seq analysis results from Illumina instrument from an external provider (SEQme). Preprocessing was correct, but the differential expression analysis was inadequate and failed to identify true resistance mechanisms. A new, statistically sound and biologically interpretable analysis is required.\n\nExperiment summary:\n- 18 samples sequenced (1 excluded after QC)\n- Resistant line BER: CK (control), CM (metronidazole), plus AK/AM (anaerobic, excluded from main analysis)\n- Sensitive lines: 2, 8, 24, 40, 41 \u2014 CK and CM\n- Reads aligned to the Giardia intestinalis A2 reference genome (93 - 97% mapping)\n- Gene quantification performed with FeatureCounts\n- Main contrasts: CK vs CM within and between lines\n\nData location:\nAll input data are in the experimental_data/ folder (count matrices, metadata, genome annotation, and QC reports). \nIncorrect SEQme analyses are included for reference only (DO NOT USE). \nRaw FASTQ/BAM files are stored externally.\n\nMain issues with SEQme analysis:\n- Only pairwise DESeq2 comparisons; no multi-factorial model\n- No FDR correction or clear filtering\n- Missing pathway or functional interpretation\n\nRequired re-analysis:\nRe-analyze RNA-seq data using an integrative, multi-layer pipeline combining statistical rigor and biological interpretation.\n\n1. Differential expression\n- Multi-factorial model: phenotype (resistant vs sensitive), treatment (control vs metronidazole), and interaction\n- Identify constitutive resistance (BER vs sensitive baseline)\n- Separate drug-induced vs resistance-specific effects\n- Control for variability among sensitive strains\n- Apply FDR-adjusted thresholds and meaningful log2FC cutoffs\n\n2. Functional analysis\n- Perform enrichment and pathway analysis (GO, KEGG, Reactome)\n- Rank candidate resistance genes for validation\n- Annotate putative or uncharacterized genes linked to resistance\n\n3. Integrative and exploratory analysis\n- Use co-expression or network clustering to find gene modules\n- Apply AI-assisted prediction for unknown gene functions (e.g., sequence, domain, or structure-based)\n\nDeliverables:\nProvide reproducible R/Python code, publication-quality visualizations (volcano plots, PCA, heatmaps, network maps), and propose new hypotheses explaining metronidazole resistance in Giardia intestinalis.\n \nDesign a transcriptomic analysis plan to identify genes specifically linked to metronidazole resistance in the BER line of Giardia intestinalis. Clearly distinguish resistance-specific effects from general drug responses and baseline strain differences. Propose a statistical model (e.g. with interaction terms) to detect these effects. Prioritize candidate resistance genes for validation and link them to biological functions using functional annotation tools. Include an approach for analyzing uncharacterized (putative) proteins.\n\nHere are the agenda questions that must be answered:\n\n1. What is the most effective approach to identify genes linked to metronidazole resistance in *Giardia intestinalis*?\n\n2. How can resistance-specific expression be separated from general drug response and baseline differences between strains?\n\n3. Is a simple comparison sufficient, or is a complex statistical model needed? Why?\n\n4. How should candidate genes be functionally annotated and connected to biological pathways?\n\n5. What strategy can identify and characterize putative (unannotated) proteins among the candidate genes?\n\n6. Are any additional files, metadata, or annotations needed to perform the analysis effectively?\n\nPrincipal Investigator will convene the meeting. Then, each team member will provide their thoughts on the discussion one-by-one in the order above. After all team members have given their input, Principal Investigator will synthesize the points raised by each team member, make decisions regarding the agenda based on team member input, and ask follow-up questions to gather more information and feedback about how to better address the agenda. This will continue for 3 rounds. Once the discussion is complete, Principal Investigator will summarize the meeting in detail for future discussions, provide a specific recommendation regarding the agenda, and answer the agenda questions (if any) based on the discussion while strictly adhering to the agenda rules (if any)."

This is an exciting and challenging project, given the unique nature of the BER line, and I'm looking forward to hearing your insights.\n\nTo begin, our primary goal is to design an effective and comprehensive analysis plan to identify genes linked specifically to metronidazole resistance in the BER line. Our agenda is clear, and I believe we're well-positioned to address each point methodically. Let's ensure our discussion remains focused and productive, so we can make informed decisions and move forward with our analysis.\n\nHere are some guiding questions for our discussion:\n\n1. **On identifying resistance-linked genes:** Given the complexity of our data, what strategies or computational tools should we prioritize to ensure we identify genes truly linked to resistance, rather than those merely associated with drug exposure or baseline differences between strains?\n\n2. **On separating resistance-specific expression:** How can we refine our statistical model to distinguish between drug-induced effects and those genuinely associated with the resistance phenotype?\n\n3. **On the adequacy of statistical modeling:** Considering the limitations of the initial analysis, should we develop a more complex statistical model with interaction terms, and how can we justify the additional complexity?\n\n4. **On functional annotation:** What tools and databases should we integrate to annotate candidate resistance genes effectively and connect them to relevant biological pathways?\n\n5. **On characterizing putative proteins:** How can we leverage AI-assisted prediction tools to identify functions of unannotated proteins, and what criteria should guide the prioritization of these proteins for further study?\n\n6. **On additional data needs:** Do we have all necessary datasets and metadata, or is there further information we should gather to optimize our analysis?\n\nI look forward to hearing each of your perspectives on these questions. Let's aim for a collaborative discussion that will help us refine our approach and ensure our findings are robust and biologically meaningful.

        "message": "Thank you, Principal Investigator. I appreciate the opportunity to share my perspective on this project. \n\n1. **Identifying resistance-linked genes:** For this, I suggest employing a multi-factorial differential expression model that accounts for phenotype (resistant vs. sensitive), treatment (control vs. metronidazole), and their interaction. This approach will help parse out resistance-specific effects from general treatment effects and baseline differences among strains.\n\n2. **Separating resistance-specific expression:** Using interaction terms in our statistical modeling is crucial. These terms will help us capture the unique gene expression patterns associated specifically with resistance, beyond what is induced by metronidazole exposure alone.\n\n3. **Statistical modeling complexity:** A simple pairwise comparison is not sufficient given the complexity of our dataset. A complex model is justified as it allows us to control for confounding variables and extract meaningful biological insights, especially when dealing with multiple sensitive lines and one resistant line.\n\n4. **Functional annotation:** For functional annotation, I recommend using a combination of tools such as InterPro, Pfam, and KEGG. These resources can help us map genes to pathways and identify potential resistance mechanisms. Additionally, we should consider pathway enrichment analyses using tools like GO and Reactome to provide a broader biological context.\n\n5. **Characterizing putative proteins:** To explore unannotated proteins, AI-assisted tools like AlphaFold can provide structural predictions. This, combined with domain-based approaches from InterPro, can lend insight into potential functions, helping us prioritize candidates for experimental validation.\n\n6. **Additional data needs:** We must ensure that our metadata is complete, especially regarding experimental conditions for each sample. This will enhance the accuracy of our statistical models. If not already available, acquiring more detailed phenotypic data on each line could also be beneficial.\n\nThese strategies collectively aim to produce a robust and comprehensive analysis, allowing us to discern true resistance mechanisms. I'm eager to hear thoughts from the rest of the team."

        "message": "Thank you, Bioinformatics Specialist, for your detailed insights. I agree with many of your points and would like to add some context from a parasitology perspective:\n\n1. **Identifying resistance-linked genes:** I concur that a multi-factorial model is key, but I would emphasize the importance of considering the biological relevance of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in the context of Giardia's unique metabolism and cell biology, which can be quite distinct from other eukaryotes.\n\n2. **Separating resistance-specific expression:** In addition to statistical modeling, incorporating knowledge of Giardia's biology is crucial. For example, genes involved in oxidative stress response, as metronidazole is known to produce toxic radicals, should be scrutinized closely for their role in resistance.\n\n3. **Statistical modeling complexity:** While complex models are necessary, they should remain interpretable. It's vital that the biological implications of interaction terms are clear, perhaps by validating findings with known resistance markers or biochemical assays.\n\n4. **Functional annotation:** Protein function in Giardia is often inferred due to limited experimental data. Hence, integrating transcriptomic data with proteomic studies, if available, could strengthen our functional annotations. Additionally, examining orthologs in related organisms might provide evolutionary insights into gene functions.\n\n5. **Characterizing putative proteins:** Uncharacterized genes should be prioritized for their potential role in resistance pathways. Bioinformatics predictions are helpful, but we should also consider experimental validation through gene knockdowns or overexpression studies in Giardia.\n\n6. **Additional data needs:** I suggest verifying whether we have access to phenotypic resistance data such as growth rates or metronidazole IC50 values for the different lines. These data could contextualize transcriptomic findings and aid in identifying resistance-specific markers.\n\nBy integrating these parasitological insights into our analysis pipeline, we can better interpret DE results in a biologically meaningful way, enhancing the relevance of our findings to the field of protozoan drug resistance. I look forward to further discussions with the team."

I agree with many of the points raised and would like to expand on a few areas from a computational biology perspective:\n\n1. **Identifying resistance-linked genes:** A multi-layered approach involving machine learning models could complement traditional statistical methods. By training models on known resistance and sensitivity patterns, we can predict additional candidates that might not emerge from statistical methods alone.\n\n2. **Separating resistance-specific expression:** Aside from including interaction terms, dimensionality reduction techniques like PCA or t-SNE could be effective in visualizing and separating expression patterns unique to resistance. These techniques can help identify clusters of genes that behave differently under resistant vs. sensitive conditions.\n\n3. **Statistical modeling complexity:** While complex models are important, we should ensure they remain computationally efficient given the dataset size. Regularization techniques might help in managing model complexity and preventing overfitting, especially when dealing with high-dimensional data.\n\n4. **Functional annotation:** Beyond standard tools like InterPro and KEGG, employing network-based approaches, such as constructing gene co-expression networks, could highlight modules that correspond to resistance pathways. These networks can reveal interactions that are not immediately obvious from a linear pathway analysis.\n\n5. **Characterizing putative proteins:** AI-assisted predictions like AlphaFold can be supplemented with docking simulations to predict potential interactions with metronidazole or its metabolites. This could provide functional clues, especially for proteins of unknown function.\n\n6. **Additional data needs:** It's crucial to have metadata that includes information on culture conditions and any previous treatments of the parasite lines to control for potential confounding factors in our analyses. This can improve the accuracy of our differential expression models.\n\nBy leveraging advanced computational techniques alongside traditional methods, we can deepen our understanding of the genetic basis of metronidazole resistance in *Giardia intestinalis*. I'm interested to see how these approaches integrate with the perspectives of other team members."

This will help streamline the process of running multiple models efficiently.\n\n3. **Statistical modeling complexity:** We need to ensure that any complexity in modeling is matched with detailed documentation and version control. Utilizing Git for version control and clear documentation in the code will be crucial for maintaining transparency and reproducibility.\n\n4. **Functional annotation:** Tools like InterProScan and KEGGREST can be integrated into an automated pipeline with Python, allowing us to annotate and analyze gene functions programmatically. Using Snakemake or Nextflow could facilitate managing this workflow\u2019s complexity, especially if we scale up the analysis with additional data.\n\n5. **Characterizing putative proteins:** We can automate AI-assisted predictions through APIs that AlphaFold or similar tools might provide, capturing results in a structured format for further analysis. This integration will ensure predictions are seamlessly included in our broader analytical framework.\n\n6. **Additional data needs:** Ensuring all metadata is captured in a structured format, possibly a CSV or a database, will be essential for automating data input into our pipeline. This will also support future updates to the dataset without significant manual reprocessing.\n\nOverall, my focus will be on ensuring that the pipeline is not only comprehensive but also user-friendly and adaptable for future extensions or modifications.

I\u2019m pleased with our direction and would like to focus on experimental validation and how it integrates with our computational predictions:\n\n1. **Experimental Assays and Validation:**\n   - To validate predictions from our computational models, I recommend using gene knockdown techniques, such as RNA interference (RNAi), to assess the functional role of candidate resistance genes in *Giardia*. This can confirm the biological relevance of our computational findings.\n   - Additionally, we can employ biochemical assays to measure oxidative stress levels or DNA repair activity in resistant vs. sensitive strains. This aligns well with our focus on oxidative stress pathways and could provide direct evidence supporting our transcriptomic data.\n\n2. **Integration with Computational Models:**\n   - Results from these experimental approaches can be fed back into the pipeline to refine our models further, ensuring they remain aligned with biological realities. This iterative process will strengthen the validation of our computational predictions.\n   - I suggest developing a framework for experimental feedback, where results from validation studies are systematically documented and used to adjust computational hypotheses and interpretations.\n\n3. **Collaboration for Biological Context:**\n   - I echo the Bioinformatics Specialist's suggestion for regular workshops or sessions to interpret complex data. These should include discussions on how experimental data might reveal new insights or necessitate adjustments to our computational approaches.\n   - Engaging with experimental parasitologists outside the immediate team could also provide broader perspectives and potentially collaborate in experimental validation efforts.\n\nThrough these approaches, we can ensure that our computational models are consistently grounded in biological reality, providing robust insights into metronidazole resistance in *Giardia*. I look forward to implementing these strategies with the team."

Functional analysis\n- Perform enrichment and pathway analysis (GO, KEGG, Reactome)\n- Rank candidate resistance genes for validation\n- Annotate putative or uncharacterized genes linked to resistance\n\n3. Integrative and exploratory analysis\n- Use co-expression or network clustering to find gene modules\n- Apply AI-assisted prediction for unknown gene functions (e.g., sequence, domain, or structure-based)\n\nDeliverables:\nProvide reproducible R/Python code, publication-quality visualizations (volcano plots, PCA, heatmaps, network maps), and propose new hypotheses explaining metronidazole resistance in Giardia intestinalis.\n \nDesign a transcriptomic analysis plan to identify genes specifically linked to metronidazole resistance in the BER line of Giardia intestinalis. Clearly distinguish resistance-specific effects from general drug responses and baseline strain differences. Propose a statistical model (e.g. with interaction terms) to detect these effects.
