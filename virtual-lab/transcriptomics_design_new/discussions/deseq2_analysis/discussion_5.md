Here is the agenda for the meeting:



You are working on a transcriptomic research project to identify genes associated with metronidazole resistance in the human parasite Giardia intestinalis.

You have a unique resistant line named BER, derived from a human patient, which has maintained stable resistance for years in culture. You also have five sensitive lines: isolates 2, 8, 40, 41, and 24.

For each isolate (both resistant BER and sensitive lines), you have RNA-seq data from control samples (without metronidazole) and from treated samples (with the same metronidazole concentration), all cultured under identical microaerobic conditions.

The goal is to identify the true molecular mechanisms of metronidazole resistance and distinguish them from general drug responses and baseline strain differences.



We received RNA-seq data analysis from an external sequencing company (SEQme). While the preprocessing and basic analysis were performed correctly, the differential expression analysis has significant limitations that prevent proper identification of resistance mechanisms.

Sequencing and Preprocessing (COMPLETED):
- 18 samples successfully sequenced (one sample excluded during QC)
- Resistant line BER: 6 samples (3 control CK, 3 metronidazole-treated CM)
- Sensitive lines (2, 8, 24, 40, 41): 12 samples (controls and treated for each line)
- PE150 sequencing, 57-80M reads per sample
- Reads aligned to Giardia intestinalis reference genome A2 (93-97% mapping rate)
- Gene quantification performed with FeatureCounts
- Data quality is good (RIN ~9.5-10 for most samples)

Their Differential Expression Analysis and Problems:

What they did:
- Used DESeq2 for simple pairwise comparisons (e.g., BERCK vs CK, CK vs CM, etc.)
- Applied criteria: log2FC ≥ 1 or ≤ -1, p-value < 0.05 (unadjusted)
- Filtering: minimum 1 CPM within at least 2 replicates (exact implementation unclear)
- Generated basic visualizations: volcano plots, MA plots, and heatmaps for selected genes

Major Problems:

1. Inadequate Statistical Approach:
   - Simple pairwise comparisons cannot distinguish resistance mechanisms from baseline strain differences
   - No multi-factorial model to account for genotype vs. treatment interaction
   - Cannot separate constitutive resistance effects from drug-induced responses
   - Cannot account for natural variation among sensitive strains

2. Inappropriate Statistical Thresholds:
   - Used unadjusted p-values (< 0.05) instead of FDR-adjusted p-values
   - High risk of false positives due to multiple testing problem
   - log2FC cutoff of ±1 may not be stringent enough for biological significance

3. Unclear Filtering Criteria:
   - "Minimum 1 CPM within at least 2 replicates" is ambiguous
   - Not clear how many genes were filtered out before analysis
   - Pre-filtering strategy not well documented

4. Missing Biological Interpretation:
   - No pathway enrichment analysis (KEGG, GO, Reactome)
   - No functional annotation of differentially expressed genes
   - No Gene Ontology term enrichment
   - Only basic visualizations without biological context

5. No Strategy for Resistance Mechanism Identification:
   - Did not define contrasts to isolate resistance-specific genes
   - Cannot distinguish between:
     * True constitutive resistance mechanisms (unique to BER)
     * Baseline transcriptomic differences between strains (unrelated to resistance)
     * General cellular response to metronidazole (present in all lines)

6. Missing Validation Strategy:
   - No ranked list of candidate resistance genes provided
   - No prioritization based on biological function or pathway involvement
   - No clear guidance for experimental validation

What We Need:
A proper re-analysis that:
- Uses a multi-factorial design to model genotype (resistant vs sensitive), treatment (control vs metronidazole), and their interaction
- Identifies genes specifically associated with constitutive resistance (differential in BER vs sensitive lines at baseline)
- Separates drug response effects (treatment-induced changes) from resistance mechanisms
- Accounts for strain-to-strain variation among the sensitive lines
- Uses appropriate statistical thresholds (adjusted p-values, appropriate log2FC cutoffs)
- Includes functional enrichment analysis to identify biological pathways involved in resistance
- Provides a ranked list of candidate resistance genes for experimental validation

AVAILABLE DATA FILES in experimental_data/ folder:

Essential files for re-analysis:
- A2_count_matrix.txt - raw gene count matrix from FeatureCounts (all 18 samples)

## Bioinformatics Statistician

Certainly! Below is a complete R script that implements the statistical analysis pipeline using DESeq2 with a multi-factorial design to identify genes associated with metronidazole resistance in Giardia intestinalis. This script addresses the limitations of the previous analysis and follows the comprehensive workflow discussed in the previous meetings.

```r
# Load necessary libraries
library(DESeq2)
library(tidyverse)

# Step 1: Load count matrix and sample metadata
count_matrix <- read.table("experimental_data/A2_count_matrix.txt", header = TRUE, row.names = 1)
sample_metadata <- read.csv("experimental_data/sample_metadata_forDEseq2_prednorm.csv", header = TRUE)

# Ensure that the sample names in the metadata match the column names in the count matrix
all(colnames(count_matrix) == sample_metadata$SampleID)

# Step 2: Create DESeq2 object with multi-factorial design
# Design formula: ~ genotype + treatment + genotype:treatment
dds <- DESeqDataSetFromMatrix(countData = count_matrix,
                              colData = sample_metadata,
                              design = ~ genotype + treatment + genotype:treatment)

# Step 3: Filter low-count genes
# Keep genes with at least 10 counts in at least 3 samples
dds <- dds[rowSums(counts(dds) >= 10) >= 3, ]

# Step 4: Run DESeq2 normalization and analysis
dds <- DESeq(dds)

# Step 5: Define contrasts to isolate resistance-specific effects
# Contrast for resistance-specific effects (interaction term)
resultsNames(dds) # Check available results names
resistance_effects <- results(dds, contrast = list("genotypeBER.treatmentCM"))

# Step 6: Extract significant genes (FDR < 0.05, |log2FC| > 1.5)
sig_genes <- resistance_effects %>%
  as.data.frame() %>%
  rownames_to_column(var = "Gene") %>%
  filter(padj < 0.05 & abs(log2FoldChange) > 1.5)

# Step 7: Perform diagnostic checks
# MA plot
plotMA(resistance_effects, ylim = c(-5, 5))

# Dispersion plot
plotDispEsts(dds)

# Step 8: Export results to CSV files
write.csv(sig_genes, "resistance_specific_genes.csv", row.names = FALSE)

# Step 9: Include clear comments
# The script above loads the count matrix and metadata, creates a DESeq2 object with a multi-factorial design,
# filters out low-count genes, normalizes the data, and performs differential expression analysis.
# It defines contrasts to isolate resistance-specific effects, extracts significant genes based on FDR and log2FC thresholds,
# performs diagnostic checks, and exports the results to a CSV file.

# End of script
```
