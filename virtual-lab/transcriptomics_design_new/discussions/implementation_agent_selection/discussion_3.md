### Further Enhanced Agenda Response

Our research initiative aims to uncover the molecular mechanisms underlying metronidazole resistance in *Giardia intestinalis*, focusing on the clinically resistant BER line. The objective is to design a comprehensive, reproducible analysis pipeline using multi-factorial models, functional annotation, and modern computational tools to identify and validate resistance-specific genes. This will involve separating resistance-specific expression from general drug responses and baseline differences, annotating candidate genes, and proposing a strategy for characterizing unannotated proteins.

### Enhanced Integrated Answer

1. **What is the most effective approach to identify genes linked to metronidazole resistance in *Giardia intestinalis*?**

   **Answer:** Implement a multi-factorial statistical model using DESeq2, incorporating phenotype (resistant vs. sensitive), treatment (control vs. metronidazole), and interaction terms. Specifically, include contrasts such as BER control vs. sensitive control and BER metronidazole vs. sensitive metronidazole to capture resistance-specific effects. Validate results using k-fold cross-validation to ensure robustness and reliability.

   **Justification:** By explicitly defining contrasts, we can better isolate resistance-specific effects, as highlighted in summaries 1 and 2. Cross-validation will involve partitioning the data into k subsets, using k-1 subsets for training and one for testing, iteratively, to ensure the model's generalizability.

2. **How can resistance-specific expression be separated from general drug response and baseline differences between strains?**

   **Answer:** Use interaction terms in the statistical model to distinguish between resistance-specific and general drug-induced effects. Apply surrogate variable analysis (SVA) to control for variability among sensitive strains, particularly focusing on batch effects and other confounding variables. Evaluate the effectiveness of SVA by quantifying the reduction in variance attributed to unwanted factors using metrics such as the proportion of variance explained.

   **Justification:** Interaction terms and SVA, as emphasized in summaries 1 and 2, provide a nuanced view of how different factors contribute to gene expression changes, ensuring precise identification of key genes. Metrics such as variance explained by surrogate variables will be used to assess SVA effectiveness.

   **Answer:** Apply AI-assisted tools like AlphaFold for structural predictions and network analysis for functional predictions. Develop a scoring system based on expression, connectivity, and evolutionary conservation to prioritize proteins for further study. The scoring system will be validated by comparing predicted functions with known protein functions in related species, using a weighted approach where criteria are selected based on their relevance to resistance mechanisms.

   **Justification:** These methods, suggested in summaries 2 and 5, provide structural and functional context, essential for hypothesizing roles of unannotated proteins and prioritizing them for further study. The scoring system will be developed using a weighted approach, with criteria selected based on their relevance to resistance mechanisms.

6. **Are any additional files, metadata, or annotations needed to perform the analysis effectively?**

   **Answer:** Ensure comprehensive metadata on experimental conditions, phenotypic resistance data, and access to relevant pathway databases like EuPathDB. Metadata management will be facilitated using software such as REDCap or similar tools to ensure consistency and ease of updates.

   **Justification:** As noted in summaries 3 and 5, complete and accurate metadata is crucial for robust statistical modeling and contextual interpretation of results. A standardized metadata template will be used to maintain consistency across samples.

[end summary 3]

Here is the agenda for the meeting:



You are part of a research initiative focused on uncovering the molecular basis of metronidazole resistance in the human parasite Giardia intestinalis.

The project investigates one unique, clinically resistant line (BER) and several sensitive lines (2, 8, 24, 40, and 41), all originally isolated from patients. 
BER is exceptional because its metronidazole resistance arose naturally in vivo and has remained stable during long-term culture, unlike laboratory-induced resistant strains. 
This makes BER a rare and biologically valuable model for studying true clinical resistance mechanisms.

The dataset includes all necessary biological controls and allows a comprehensive exploration of resistance mechanisms. 
The goal is to identify transcriptomic changes and pathways specific to natural metronidazole resistance and to highlight putative or uncharacterized genes that may represent new resistance factors.

Your task is to design and implement a complete, reproducible, and automatable analysis pipeline — from statistical modeling to functional interpretation — producing well-documented R or Python code for differential expression, visualization, and annotation. 
You may also apply modern computational tools (e.g., AlphaFold, InterPro, Pfam) to assist in functional prediction of unannotated genes. 
If additional information is required, you are encouraged to ask the project lead. Collaboration and clear reasoning are preferred.



We received RNA-seq analysis results from Illumina instrument from an external provider (SEQme). Preprocessing was correct, but the differential expression analysis was inadequate and failed to identify true resistance mechanisms. A new, statistically sound and biologically interpretable analysis is required.

Experiment summary:
- 18 samples sequenced (1 excluded after QC)
- Resistant line BER: CK (control), CM (metronidazole), plus AK/AM (anaerobic, excluded from main analysis)
- Sensitive lines: 2, 8, 24, 40, 41 — CK and CM
- Reads aligned to the Giardia intestinalis A2 reference genome (93 - 97% mapping)
- Gene quantification performed with FeatureCounts
- Main contrasts: CK vs CM within and between lines

Data location:
All input data are in the experimental_data/ folder (count matrices, metadata, genome annotation, and QC reports). 
Incorrect SEQme analyses are included for reference only (DO NOT USE). 
Raw FASTQ/BAM files are stored externally.

Main issues with SEQme analysis:
- Only pairwise DESeq2 comparisons; no multi-factorial model
- No FDR correction or clear filtering
- Missing pathway or functional interpretation

Required re-analysis:
Re-analyze RNA-seq data using an integrative, multi-layer pipeline combining statistical rigor and biological interpretation.

1. Differential expression
- Multi-factorial model: phenotype (resistant vs sensitive), treatment (control vs metronidazole), and interaction
- Identify constitutive resistance (BER vs sensitive baseline)
- Separate drug-induced vs resistance-specific effects
- Control for variability among sensitive strains
- Apply FDR-adjusted thresholds and meaningful log2FC cutoffs

2. Functional analysis
- Perform enrichment and pathway analysis (GO, KEGG, Reactome)
- Rank candidate resistance genes for validation
- Annotate putative or uncharacterized genes linked to resistance

3. Integrative and exploratory analysis
- Use co-expression or network clustering to find gene modules
- Apply AI-assisted prediction for unknown gene functions (e.g., sequence, domain, or structure-based)

Deliverables:
Provide reproducible R/Python code, publication-quality visualizations (volcano plots, PCA, heatmaps, network maps), and propose new hypotheses explaining metronidazole resistance in Giardia intestinalis.
