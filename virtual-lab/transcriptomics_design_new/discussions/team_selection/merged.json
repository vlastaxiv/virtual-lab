Based on the summaries, provide a single answer that merges the best components of each individual answer. Please use the same format as the individual answers. Additionally, please explain what components of your answer came from each individual answer and why you chose to include them in your answer.\n\nAs a reference, here is the agenda from those meetings, which must be addressed here as well:\n\n\n\nYou are working on a transcriptomic research project to identify genes associated with metronidazole resistance in the human parasite Giardia intestinalis.\n\nYou have a unique resistant line named BER, derived from a human patient, which has maintained stable resistance for years in culture. You also have five sensitive lines: isolates 2, 8, 40, 41, and 24.\n\nFor each isolate (both resistant BER and sensitive lines), you have RNA-seq data from control samples (without metronidazole) and from treated samples (with the same metronidazole concentration), all cultured under identical microaerobic conditions.\n\nThe goal is to identify the true molecular mechanisms of metronidazole resistance and distinguish them from general drug responses and baseline strain differences.\n\n\n\nWe received RNA-seq data analysis from an external sequencing company (SEQme). While the preprocessing and basic analysis were performed correctly, the differential expression analysis has significant limitations that prevent proper identification of resistance mechanisms.\n\nSequencing and Preprocessing (COMPLETED):\n- 18 samples successfully sequenced (one sample excluded during QC)\n- Resistant line BER: 6 samples (3 control CK, 3 metronidazole-treated CM)\n- Sensitive lines (2, 8, 24, 40, 41): 12 samples (controls and treated for each line)\n- PE150 sequencing, 57-80M reads per sample\n- Reads aligned to Giardia intestinalis reference genome A2 (93-97% mapping rate)\n- Gene quantification performed with FeatureCounts\n- Data quality is good (RIN ~9.5-10 for most samples)\n\nTheir Differential Expression Analysis and Problems:\n\nWhat they did:\n- Used DESeq2 for simple pairwise comparisons (e.g., BERCK vs CK, CK vs CM, etc.)\n- Applied criteria: log2FC \u2265 1 or \u2264 -1, p-value < 0.05 (unadjusted)\n- Filtering: minimum 1 CPM within at least 2 replicates (exact implementation unclear)\n- Generated basic visualizations: volcano plots, MA plots, and heatmaps for selected genes\n\nMajor Problems:\n\n1. Inadequate Statistical Approach:\n   - Simple pairwise comparisons cannot distinguish resistance mechanisms from baseline strain differences\n   - No multi-factorial model to account for genotype vs. treatment interaction\n   - Cannot separate constitutive resistance effects from drug-induced responses\n   - Cannot account for natural variation among sensitive strains\n\n2. Inappropriate Statistical Thresholds:\n   - Used unadjusted p-values (< 0.05) instead of FDR-adjusted p-values\n   - High risk of false positives due to multiple testing problem\n   - log2FC cutoff of \u00b11 may not be stringent enough for biological significance\n\n3. Unclear Filtering Criteria:\n   - \"Minimum 1 CPM within at least 2 replicates\" is ambiguous\n   - Not clear how many genes were filtered out before analysis\n   - Pre-filtering strategy not well documented\n\n4. Missing Biological Interpretation:\n   - No pathway enrichment analysis (KEGG, GO, Reactome)\n   - No functional annotation of differentially expressed genes\n   - No Gene Ontology term enrichment\n   - Only basic visualizations without biological context\n\n5. No Strategy for Resistance Mechanism Identification:\n   - Did not define contrasts to isolate resistance-specific genes\n   - Cannot distinguish between:\n     * True constitutive resistance mechanisms (unique to BER)\n     * Baseline transcriptomic differences between strains (unrelated to resistance)\n     * General cellular response to metronidazole (present in all lines)\n\n6. Missing Validation Strategy:\n   - No ranked list of candidate resistance genes provided\n   - No prioritization based on biological function or pathway involvement\n   - No clear guidance for experimental validation\n\nWhat We Need:\nA proper re-analysis that:\n- Uses a multi-factorial design to model genotype (resistant vs sensitive), treatment (control vs metronidazole), and their interaction\n- Identifies genes specifically associated with constitutive resistance (differential in BER vs sensitive lines at baseline)\n- Separates drug response effects (treatment-induced changes) from resistance mechanisms\n- Accounts for strain-to-strain variation among the sensitive lines\n- Uses appropriate statistical thresholds (adjusted p-values, appropriate log2FC cutoffs)\n- Includes functional enrichment analysis to identify biological pathways involved in resistance\n- Provides a ranked list of candidate resistance genes for experimental validation\n\nAVAILABLE DATA FILES in experimental_data/ folder:\n\nEssential files for re-analysis:\n- A2_count_matrix.txt - raw gene count matrix from FeatureCounts (all 18 samples)\n- raw_counts_matrix_forDEseq2_prednorm.csv - alternative format count matrix\n- sample_metadata_forDEseq2_prednorm.csv - sample metadata (strain, treatment)\n- exp-design.txt - experimental design information\n- Counts_with_geneNames.txt - count matrix with gene names\n- genome_annotation/ - Giardia intestinalis A2 genome annotation files\n\nQuality control reports:\n- 242114199_multiqc_report.html - comprehensive QC report (FastQC, alignment stats)\n- SEQme-NGS_report-Order_no_242114199.pdf - full analysis report from SEQme\n- DGE4199_stats.xlsx - statistics summary\n- PCA_top500_log2_autoscale_colored_labels.png - PCA visualization\n\nTheir problematic analysis results (for reference only - DO NOT USE):\n- SEQme_DGE_results/ - folder containing all their pairwise DESeq2 comparisons\n  * These results are fundamentally flawed due to inappropriate statistical approach\n  * Provided for reference only to understand what NOT to do\n  * The raw count matrix should be re-analyzed properly with multi-factorial design\n\nNote: Raw sequencing data (FASTQ, BAM files) are available on external storage if needed for quality validation.\n\n\nYou need to select a team of four scientists to help you with this transcriptomics project. The team should deal with these analytical challenges:\n\n- Multi-factorial statistical modeling to separate resistance from confounding factors\n- RNA-seq analysis and differential expression (DESeq2, edgeR)\n- Biological interpretation in the context of Giardia intestinalis biology and protozoan drug resistance\n- Implementation (R/Bioconductor, Python)\n- Functional annotation and characterization of putative/hypothetical proteins\n\nNOTE: Giardia intestinalis is a unique protozoan parasite with unusual biology. Understanding gene expression changes requires expertise in parasite physiology and drug resistance mechanisms.\n\nIMPORTANT: Many Giardia genes are annotated as \"putative protein\" or \"hypothetical protein\". The team needs expertise in:\n- Protein function prediction (sequence homology, domain analysis, structural prediction)\n- Comparative genomics to infer function from related organisms\n- Literature mining and database searches to assign putative functions\n\nPlease select the team members in the following format. You should NOT include yourself (Principal Investigator) in the list. Write the team as a Python list of Agent objects with \"model=model\" as the last parameter.\n\nAgent(\n    title=\"Principal Investigator\",\n    expertise=\"transcriptomics, RNA-seq analysis, microbial drug resistance, experimental design\",\n    goal=\"identify molecular mechanisms of metronidazole resistance in Giardia intestinalis\",\n    role=\"lead a team of experts to properly re-analyze the RNA-seq data and identify validated candidate resistance genes\",\n    model=model,\n)\n\nPrincipal Investigator, please provide your response.\n\n\n\n\nPrincipal Investigator, please provide your response to the agenda."
