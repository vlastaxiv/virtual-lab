## User

This is the beginning of a team meeting to discuss your research project. This is a meeting with the team lead, Principal Investigator, and the following team members: Bioinformatics Specialist, Parasitology Expert, Computational Biologist, Software Developer.

Here is the agenda for the meeting:




You are part of a research initiative focused on uncovering the molecular basis of metronidazole resistance in the human parasite Giardia intestinalis.

The project investigates one unique, clinically resistant line (BER) and several sensitive lines (2, 8, 24, 40, and 41), all originally isolated from patients. 
BER is exceptional because its metronidazole resistance arose naturally in vivo and has remained stable during long-term culture, unlike laboratory-induced resistant strains. 
This makes BER a rare and biologically valuable model for studying true clinical resistance mechanisms.

The dataset includes all necessary biological controls and allows a comprehensive exploration of resistance mechanisms. 
The goal is to identify transcriptomic changes and pathways specific to natural metronidazole resistance and to highlight putative or uncharacterized genes that may represent new resistance factors.

Your task is to design and implement a complete, reproducible, and automatable analysis pipeline — from statistical modeling to functional interpretation — producing well-documented R or Python code for differential expression, visualization, and annotation. 
You may also apply modern computational tools (e.g., AlphaFold, InterPro, Pfam) to assist in functional prediction of unannotated genes. 
If additional information is required, you are encouraged to ask the project lead. Collaboration and clear reasoning are preferred.



We received RNA-seq analysis results from Illumina instrument from an external provider (SEQme). Preprocessing was correct, but the differential expression analysis was inadequate and failed to identify true resistance mechanisms. A new, statistically sound and biologically interpretable analysis is required.

Experiment summary:
- 18 samples sequenced (1 excluded after QC)
- Resistant line BER: CK (control), CM (metronidazole), plus AK/AM (anaerobic, excluded from main analysis)
- Sensitive lines: 2, 8, 24, 40, 41 — CK and CM
- Reads aligned to the Giardia intestinalis A2 reference genome (93 - 97% mapping)
- Gene quantification performed with FeatureCounts
- Main contrasts: CK vs CM within and between lines

Data location:
All input data are in the experimental_data/ folder (count matrices, metadata, genome annotation, and QC reports). 
Incorrect SEQme analyses are included for reference only (DO NOT USE). 
Raw FASTQ/BAM files are stored externally.

Main issues with SEQme analysis:
- Only pairwise DESeq2 comparisons; no multi-factorial model
- No FDR correction or clear filtering
- Missing pathway or functional interpretation

Required re-analysis:
Re-analyze RNA-seq data using an integrative, multi-layer pipeline combining statistical rigor and biological interpretation.

1. Differential expression
- Multi-factorial model: phenotype (resistant vs sensitive), treatment (control vs metronidazole), and interaction
- Identify constitutive resistance (BER vs sensitive baseline)
- Separate drug-induced vs resistance-specific effects
- Control for variability among sensitive strains
- Apply FDR-adjusted thresholds and meaningful log2FC cutoffs

2. Functional analysis
- Perform enrichment and pathway analysis (GO, KEGG, Reactome)
- Rank candidate resistance genes for validation
- Annotate putative or uncharacterized genes linked to resistance

3. Integrative and exploratory analysis
- Use co-expression or network clustering to find gene modules
- Apply AI-assisted prediction for unknown gene functions (e.g., sequence, domain, or structure-based)

Deliverables:
Provide reproducible R/Python code, publication-quality visualizations (volcano plots, PCA, heatmaps, network maps), and propose new hypotheses explaining metronidazole resistance in Giardia intestinalis.
 
Design a transcriptomic analysis plan to identify genes specifically linked to metronidazole resistance in the BER line of Giardia intestinalis. Clearly distinguish resistance-specific effects from general drug responses and baseline strain differences. Propose a statistical model (e.g. with interaction terms) to detect these effects. Prioritize candidate resistance genes for validation and link them to biological functions using functional annotation tools. Include an approach for analyzing uncharacterized (putative) proteins.

Here are the agenda questions that must be answered:

1. What is the most effective approach to identify genes linked to metronidazole resistance in *Giardia intestinalis*?

2. How can resistance-specific expression be separated from general drug response and baseline differences between strains?

3. Is a simple comparison sufficient, or is a complex statistical model needed? Why?

4. How should candidate genes be functionally annotated and connected to biological pathways?

5. What strategy can identify and characterize putative (unannotated) proteins among the candidate genes?

6. Are any additional files, metadata, or annotations needed to perform the analysis effectively?

Principal Investigator will convene the meeting. Then, each team member will provide their thoughts on the discussion one-by-one in the order above. After all team members have given their input, Principal Investigator will synthesize the points raised by each team member, make decisions regarding the agenda based on team member input, and ask follow-up questions to gather more information and feedback about how to better address the agenda. This will continue for 3 rounds. Once the discussion is complete, Principal Investigator will summarize the meeting in detail for future discussions, provide a specific recommendation regarding the agenda, and answer the agenda questions (if any) based on the discussion while strictly adhering to the agenda rules (if any).

## User

Principal Investigator, please provide your initial thoughts on the agenda as well as any questions you have to guide the discussion among the team members.

## Principal Investigator

As we begin our meeting, I'd like to highlight the importance of our task: uncovering the molecular mechanisms of metronidazole resistance in the Giardia intestinalis BER line. This unique clinical isolate provides us a rare opportunity to understand true clinical resistance, distinct from what we see in laboratory-induced strains.

Our agenda is clear, and our goal is to develop a robust, integrative transcriptomic analysis pipeline that draws meaningful conclusions from our data. The fact that prior analysis failed to capture the resistance mechanisms underscores the necessity for a robust statistical model and thorough biological interpretation. 

To guide our discussion, here are some key questions and considerations I'd like each of you to reflect on:

1. **Bioinformatics Specialist**: How can we most effectively leverage our dataset to identify genes linked to metronidazole resistance, taking into account both treatment and strain effects? What specific multi-factorial models should we consider?

2. **Parasitology Expert**: From a biological perspective, how can we distinguish resistance-specific expression from general drug responses and baseline strain differences? What biological insights can aid in interpreting our findings?

3. **Computational Biologist**: Is a complex statistical model necessary, or could a simpler approach suffice for our purposes? What justifications support your choice, particularly in terms of revealing subtle resistance mechanisms?

4. **Software Developer**: How can we ensure functional annotation and pathway connection for candidate genes, especially considering those that are uncharacterized? What tools or computational methods could enhance this aspect of our analysis?

5. **General Consideration**: Do we have all the necessary files, metadata, and annotations to perform our analysis effectively, or are there additional resources we need to acquire?

By addressing these questions, we'll be equipped to develop a comprehensive and reproducible analysis strategy. Let's proceed with each team member providing their input in the order outlined.

## User

Bioinformatics Specialist, please provide your thoughts on the discussion (round 1 of 3). If you do not have anything new or relevant to add, you may say "pass". Remember that you can and should (politely) disagree with other team members if you have a different perspective.

## Bioinformatics Specialist

Thank you for the opportunity to provide my input. For our task to identify genes linked to metronidazole resistance in Giardia intestinalis, I propose the following:

1. **Differential Expression Approach**: We need to implement a multi-factorial model using DESeq2 or edgeR that accounts for several factors: phenotype (resistant vs sensitive), treatment (control vs metronidazole), and interaction terms. This complexity is necessary because it will allow us to separate the effects of drug treatment from intrinsic resistance mechanisms specific to the BER line. Simple pairwise comparisons are insufficient as they fail to account for these interactions.

2. **Separation of Effects**: By incorporating interaction terms in our model, we can distinguish between constitutive resistance effects and drug-induced responses. The model will look something like: `~ phenotype + treatment + phenotype:treatment`, where the interaction term `phenotype:treatment` will help us identify resistance-specific expression changes.

3. **Statistical Complexity**: A complex statistical model is indeed needed. This is because resistance mechanisms are likely to involve subtle changes that a simple model might overlook. Our goal is to discern these intricate biological patterns amidst the noise.

4. **Data Preparation**: We need to ensure our count matrix and metadata are well-curated and that we apply stringent FDR correction and appropriate log2FC cutoffs to minimize false positives while capturing true biological effects.

I believe this approach will provide us with a robust framework for identifying the genetic basis of resistance in the BER line, and I'm open to discussing these ideas further with the team.

Parasitology Expert, please provide your thoughts on the discussion (round 1 of 3). If you do not have anything new or relevant to add, you may say "pass". Remember that you can and should (politely) disagree with other team members if you have a different perspective.

## Parasitology Expert

Thank you for the opportunity to contribute. From a parasitology and biological perspective, the main challenge lies in accurately distinguishing true resistance mechanisms from general drug responses and variations inherent across different strains. Here are my thoughts:

1. **Biological Context of Resistance**: In Giardia, metronidazole resistance can involve multiple pathways, including alterations in oxidative stress response, energy metabolism, and possibly drug activation/deactivation pathways. It's critical that we contextualize our findings within these known biological systems to identify which genes or pathways are genuinely contributing to resistance in the BER line.

2. **Interaction Effects**: I agree with the Bioinformatics Specialist that a multi-factorial model is crucial. By examining interaction terms, we can identify genes that are differentially expressed specifically in the resistant line when exposed to metronidazole, highlighting resistance-specific adaptations rather than general drug effects.

3. **Interpreting Biological Significance**: It is important to prioritize candidates that align with known or plausible resistance mechanisms. For instance, changes in the expression of enzymes related to the pyruvate:ferredoxin oxidoreductase (PFOR) pathway, which is involved in activating metronidazole, could indicate a role in resistance.

4. **Functional Annotation Needs**: Many Giardia genes remain uncharacterized. Functional annotation should focus on novel or poorly understood proteins that show differential expression patterns. Using tools like InterPro or Pfam, we can predict domains and potential functions, especially for genes upregulated in the BER line under metronidazole exposure.

5. **Additional Requirements**: We should ensure we have complete and accurate genome annotations, as potential errors or gaps here can mislead our conclusions about resistance mechanisms.

Overall, ensuring our analysis captures the biological complexity and specificity of resistance mechanisms is key. I'm eager to see how these points integrate into our analytical strategy.

Computational Biologist, please provide your thoughts on the discussion (round 1 of 3). If you do not have anything new or relevant to add, you may say "pass". Remember that you can and should (politely) disagree with other team members if you have a different perspective.

## Computational Biologist

Thank you for allowing me to contribute. I appreciate the insights from the Bioinformatics Specialist and the Parasitology Expert. Here are my additional thoughts from a computational biology perspective:

1. **Complex Statistical Model**: I concur with both team members that a complex model is necessary. The multi-factorial approach will help us capture the nuances of metronidazole resistance that simple pairwise comparisons would miss. However, I would emphasize the importance of ensuring our model is not overfitting, which could obscure true signals. Conducting validation tests on subsets of the data could help verify the model's robustness.

2. **AI and Machine Learning Tools**: To enhance our functional prediction efforts, we should integrate AI tools for analyzing uncharacterized genes. Tools like AlphaFold for structural predictions or ML-based gene annotation platforms could provide insights into protein functions that are not immediately obvious from sequence homology alone.

3. **Functional Annotation**: While InterPro and Pfam are excellent for domain analysis, I suggest extending our analysis to include network-based approaches. By building gene co-expression networks, we might identify key modules associated with resistance. Tools like WGCNA can help in clustering genes with similar expression patterns, offering an additional layer of functional prediction.

4. **Integrative Analysis**: Beyond differential expression, integrating multi-omics data (if available) could provide a more comprehensive view of resistance mechanisms. For instance, correlating transcriptomic changes with proteomic data might uncover post-transcriptional modifications or protein-protein interactions relevant to resistance.

5. **Data Completeness**: I agree that complete genome annotations are vital. Additionally, it may be beneficial to have information on the metabolic pathways specific to Giardia intestinalis, as this could refine our pathway analyses and help contextualize our findings within known metabolic frameworks.

These computational strategies should enhance our ability to characterize the putative proteins and uncover novel insights into the resistance mechanisms at play. I'm looking forward to how these suggestions can be integrated into our pipeline.

Software Developer, please provide your thoughts on the discussion (round 1 of 3). If you do not have anything new or relevant to add, you may say "pass". Remember that you can and should (politely) disagree with other team members if you have a different perspective.

## Software Developer

Thank you for the opportunity to share my thoughts. Building on the excellent points already raised, my focus will be on ensuring our workflow is automated, reproducible, and well-documented:

1. **Reproducibility and Automation**: We need to implement the entire pipeline using either Snakemake or Nextflow, which will ensure that each step of the analysis is automated and can be easily repeated. This will also help us track dependencies and ensure that any updates or changes to the analysis can be systematically applied.

2. **Version Control**: Using Git for version control is essential. We should maintain a central repository with branches for different stages of development and analysis. This will enable collaborative work while preserving a record of changes.

3. **Documentation**: Clear and comprehensive documentation is crucial. Each script or computational tool used within the pipeline should be accompanied by detailed instructions on usage, input/output formats, and expected results. This documentation should be regularly updated and included within the repository for easy access.

4. **Functional Annotation**: From a technical perspective, integrating functional annotation tools directly into our pipeline will streamline the analysis. We can use tools like Bioconductor packages in R or BioPython modules to annotate genes and predict functions, making sure these tools are part of the automated workflow.

5. **Handling Uncharacterized Proteins**: To handle putative proteins, we could integrate tools like AlphaFold or other prediction platforms into our pipeline. This would require setting up computational resources that can handle the processing demands of these tools, so I recommend utilizing cloud-based services if local resources are insufficient.

6. **Additional Requirements**: We may need additional metadata or annotations, especially if there are updates to genome databases that could refine our gene annotations. Ensuring regular updates and synchronization with external databases will be important.

By implementing these technical solutions, we'll ensure that our workflow is not only effective but also reproducible and accessible for future analyses. I look forward to collaborating with the team to bring these ideas to fruition.

## Parasitology Expert

Thank you for this opportunity to continue contributing. Building on the current plan, here are some thoughts on prioritizing specific metabolic pathways and gene families in our functional analysis:

1. **Key Metabolic Pathways**:
   - **Pyruvate:Ferredoxin Oxidoreductase (PFOR) Pathway**: This pathway is critical for activating metronidazole in Giardia. Genes involved here should be a primary focus as alterations could directly relate to resistance.
   - **Oxidative Stress Response**: Resistance could involve mechanisms that detoxify reactive oxygen species generated by metronidazole activation. Investigating genes related to antioxidant defense, such as those encoding superoxide dismutase or thioredoxin, is important.
   - **Energy Metabolism**: Changes in glycolysis or other energy-related pathways might indicate shifts in metabolic activity under drug pressure, which can be linked to resistance.

2. **Gene Families**:
   - **NADH Oxidase and Related Enzymes**: Variations in the expression of these enzymes might reflect adaptive strategies to manage redox balance in response to drug-induced stress.
   - **Transporters**: Consider exploring ABC transporters or other efflux systems that could facilitate drug expulsion or reduce intracellular drug concentrations.

3. **Gene Validation**:
   - Prioritize genes that align with known resistance mechanisms or emerging hypotheses. For example, genes involved in drug activation, detoxification, or regulatory pathways managing cellular stress responses.

4. **Cross-reference with Literature**:
   - Use current literature and existing databases to cross-reference our findings, ensuring that our hypotheses are grounded in both novel discovery and established biological knowledge.

These recommendations should help sharpen our focus when interpreting differentially expressed genes, directing our validation efforts towards the most promising candidates. I look forward to integrating these insights into the pipeline and furthering our understanding of metronidazole resistance in Giardia intestinalis.

## Computational Biologist

Thank you for the continued opportunity to contribute. I agree with the proposed pipeline and priorities, and I'd like to provide some additional thoughts on integrating AI tools like AlphaFold and managing our computational resources:

1. **Integration of AI Tools**:
   - **AlphaFold and Structure Prediction**: We can integrate AlphaFold by setting up a dedicated stage in the pipeline for structural prediction of proteins that lack characterization. This step can be parallelized to efficiently handle the computational load and should focus on proteins that show significant differential expression and lack known domains.
   - **Resource Management**: Utilizing cloud-based services can help manage the computational demand. Platforms like AWS or Google Cloud offer scalable resources, and we can configure instances that specifically cater to high-memory and GPU-intensive tasks necessary for AlphaFold.

2. **Network Analysis**:
   - **Co-expression Networks**: Using WGCNA as planned is excellent for identifying modules of co-expressed genes. This should be integrated into the pipeline following differential expression analysis to find clusters of genes that may work in concert as part of resistance mechanisms.
   - **Functional Enrichment of Modules**: Once modules are identified, we can perform enrichment analysis for each to pinpoint pathways or biological processes that are significantly represented.

3. **Data Integration Strategy**:
   - If proteomic or metabolomic data becomes available, we should consider integrating these data types to provide a more comprehensive view of resistance mechanisms. Techniques like multi-omics factor analysis could be employed to uncover interactions across different biological levels.

4. **Validation Strategy**:
   - For the candidate genes identified, we should plan for experimental validation. This could include gene knockdowns or overexpression studies in Giardia to confirm the role of these genes in resistance.

By incorporating these computational strategies, we can enhance our ability to identify and characterize resistance mechanisms effectively. I'm excited about the potential insights these approaches can provide and look forward to further discussions on how to optimize our pipeline.

   - **Cloud Integration**: Incorporating cloud services such as AWS or Google Cloud is a practical solution for computationally demanding tasks like structural predictions and large-scale network analyses. We can automate the deployment of cloud instances within Snakemake, ensuring resources are allocated efficiently and only when needed, thereby optimizing cost-effectiveness.

2. **Snakemake Workflow**:
   - **Modular Structure**: Designing the pipeline in a modular fashion will allow us to test individual components independently and facilitate easier debugging and updates. Each step, from data preparation to visualization, should be a distinct module with clearly defined inputs and outputs.
   - **Resource Specification**: Within Snakemake, we can specify resource requirements for each rule (e.g., memory, CPU, GPU). This will help ensure that tasks are allocated appropriate resources, especially for steps like AlphaFold predictions.

3. **Version Control and Collaboration**:
   - **GitHub Repository**: Establishing a GitHub repository will be critical for maintaining version control. We should set up a branching strategy that allows for collaborative development while protecting the main branch from unstable changes.
   - **Documentation**: Each module should have comprehensive documentation within the repository, possibly using Jupyter Notebooks or Markdown files, which can serve as both a user guide and a means for troubleshooting.

4. **Data Integrity and Security**:
   - **Data Tracking**: Implement checksums or hash verification for input data files to ensure integrity across different stages of the pipeline.
   - **Secure Access**: Secure authentication methods should be in place for accessing sensitive data or cloud resources to maintain data privacy and security.

5. **Potential Challenges**:
   - **Dependency Management**: Ensuring all necessary software and package dependencies are installed correctly on different systems can be managed using containerization tools like Docker. This approach will help in creating a consistent computational environment across all users.

With these strategies, our workflow will be robust, easily reproducible, and scalable, accommodating future extensions or modifications. Looking forward to aligning these technical aspects with our biological objectives to achieve meaningful insights into metronidazole resistance.

## Bioinformatics Specialist

Thank you for the continued opportunity to contribute. In response to the Principal Investigator's request, here are my thoughts on expanding the differential expression analysis:

1. **Specific Contrasts**:
   - **Within-Line Contrasts**: For each line (resistant and sensitive), we should compare control (CK) versus metronidazole-treated (CM) conditions. This will help identify drug-induced expression changes specific to each line.
   - **Between-Line Contrasts**: Compare the resistant line (BER) to each sensitive line under both control and metronidazole-treated conditions. This will highlight constitutive differences due to resistance.
   - **Interaction Contrasts**: Use interaction terms to contrast how the expression changes between control and metronidazole conditions differ across resistant and sensitive lines. This will pinpoint genes that respond differently to treatment depending on resistance status.

2. **Additional Considerations**:
   - **Batch Effects**: Ensure that potential batch effects are controlled by including line and batch information as blocking factors in the model.
   - **Filtering Criteria**: Apply stringent p-value thresholds and log2 fold-change cutoffs, correcting for multiple comparisons using the Benjamini-Hochberg method to control for false discovery rates.
   - **Outlier Detection**: Identify and handle outliers that could skew the results, ensuring robustness of findings.

By structuring our differential expression analysis with these contrasts, we can dissect the layers of expression changes, distinguishing between general drug responses and resistance-specific mechanisms. I'm eager to see how these insights integrate into our overall analytical strategy.

## Parasitology Expert

Thank you for the opportunity to provide further input. In response to the Principal Investigator's query about additional resources for validating our prioritized pathways and candidate genes, here are my thoughts:

1. **Experimental Data for Validation**:
   - Consider using existing datasets from similar studies on Giardia metronidazole resistance as a comparative framework to validate our findings.
   - If possible, collaborate with labs that can perform functional assays, such as gene knockdown or overexpression studies, to experimentally validate candidate resistance genes in Giardia.

2. **Literature Resources**:
   - **Systematic Reviews**: Review recent systematic reviews or meta-analyses on metronidazole resistance mechanisms in protozoa. These can provide a comprehensive overview of known mechanisms that might overlap with our findings.
   - **Cross-Species Comparison**: Look into studies of metronidazole resistance in other protozoan parasites, such as Trichomonas vaginalis or Entamoeba histolytica, to identify common resistance pathways that may be conserved across species.

3. **Pathway Databases**:
   - Utilize resources like KEGG and Reactome for insights into pathways that are potentially involved in resistance. These databases can provide existing pathway maps that align with our candidate genes.
   - **Giardia-Specific Databases**: If available, consult databases dedicated to Giardia biology for additional context and previously noted resistance genes or pathways.

Integrating these experimental and literature sources will help reinforce the biological validity of our candidate genes and pathways, providing a more comprehensive understanding of metronidazole resistance in Giardia intestinalis. I look forward to seeing how these resources can enhance our study.

## Computational Biologist

Thank you for allowing me to continue contributing. Regarding the integration of potential multi-omics data, here’s how we could enhance our analysis if such data becomes available:

1. **Data Integration Strategy**:
   - **Layered Analysis**: Employ a layered approach where transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics data are integrated. This will allow us to corroborate findings across different biological levels and provide a more holistic view of resistance mechanisms.
   - **Multi-Omics Tools**: Utilize tools like MOFA (Multi-Omics Factor Analysis) or mixOmics, which are designed to integrate and analyze multi-omics datasets. These tools can help identify shared patterns and interactions across different data types.

2. **Cross-Validation**:
   - Use proteomic data to validate transcriptomic findings, particularly looking at protein abundance changes corresponding to differentially expressed genes. This reinforces the reliability of our identified resistance mechanisms.
   - Metabolomics data can help elucidate metabolic shifts in resistant strains, providing additional context to gene expression changes.

3. **Data Mining**:
   - Leverage machine learning techniques to predict interactions and infer causal relationships between omics layers. This could involve clustering methods or network inference to detect key nodes associated with resistance.

4. **Visualization**:
   - Develop integrative visualizations that map changes across omics layers, potentially using platforms like Cytoscape for network visualization. This makes complex data more interpretable and actionable.

5. **Preparation and Planning**:
   - Although we may not have immediate access to additional omics data, planning for such an integration means we can be agile and responsive if opportunities arise to collect or access these data types.

By preparing to incorporate multi-omics data, we position ourselves to enhance our understanding of metronidazole resistance through a comprehensive, systems biology approach. This could lead to more robust insights and novel therapeutic targets. Looking forward to seeing how this can be applied to our project.

Thank you for the opportunity to provide additional input. In response to the Principal Investigator's query about data security, especially when using cloud services, here are some recommendations:

1. **Data Security Measures**:
   - **Encryption**: Ensure all data, both at rest and in transit, is encrypted using strong encryption standards (e.g., AES-256). This will protect data from unauthorized access.
   - **Access Controls**: Implement strict access controls, using role-based access permissions to ensure that only authorized personnel can access sensitive data. This can be managed through cloud provider IAM (Identity and Access Management) services.

2. **Cloud Security Tools**:
   - Use cloud-native security tools provided by platforms like AWS or Google Cloud, such as AWS KMS (Key Management Service) for managing encryption keys and Google Cloud's IAM for setting detailed access policies.
   - Regularly audit and monitor cloud activities using services like AWS CloudTrail or Google Cloud Audit Logs to track access and changes to the data.

3. **Containerization**:
   - Employ containerization technologies like Docker to create isolated environments, ensuring that software dependencies and data are packaged securely. This improves reproducibility and security by minimizing the attack surface.

4. **Data Backup and Recovery**:
   - Establish a robust backup and recovery strategy, ensuring that data is regularly backed up to secure locations. This can mitigate data loss risks due to unforeseen incidents.

5. **Compliance and Best Practices**:
   - Ensure compliance with relevant data protection regulations such as GDPR or HIPAA, if applicable, and regularly review security policies to adhere to best practices.

By implementing these security measures, we can protect our data throughout its lifecycle, especially when utilizing cloud services. This will help ensure the integrity and confidentiality of our research data as we proceed with our project. Looking forward to supporting the team in setting up these security protocols within our pipeline.

Principal Investigator, please summarize the meeting in detail for future discussions, provide a specific recommendation regarding the agenda, and answer the agenda questions (if any) based on the discussion while strictly adhering to the agenda rules (if any).

As a reminder, here is the agenda for the meeting:




You are part of a research initiative focused on uncovering the molecular basis of metronidazole resistance in the human parasite Giardia intestinalis.

The project investigates one unique, clinically resistant line (BER) and several sensitive lines (2, 8, 24, 40, and 41), all originally isolated from patients. 
BER is exceptional because its metronidazole resistance arose naturally in vivo and has remained stable during long-term culture, unlike laboratory-induced resistant strains. 
This makes BER a rare and biologically valuable model for studying true clinical resistance mechanisms.

The dataset includes all necessary biological controls and allows a comprehensive exploration of resistance mechanisms. 
The goal is to identify transcriptomic changes and pathways specific to natural metronidazole resistance and to highlight putative or uncharacterized genes that may represent new resistance factors.

Your task is to design and implement a complete, reproducible, and automatable analysis pipeline — from statistical modeling to functional interpretation — producing well-documented R or Python code for differential expression, visualization, and annotation. 
You may also apply modern computational tools (e.g., AlphaFold, InterPro, Pfam) to assist in functional prediction of unannotated genes. 
If additional information is required, you are encouraged to ask the project lead. Collaboration and clear reasoning are preferred.



We received RNA-seq analysis results from Illumina instrument from an external provider (SEQme). Preprocessing was correct, but the differential expression analysis was inadequate and failed to identify true resistance mechanisms. A new, statistically sound and biologically interpretable analysis is required.

Experiment summary:
- 18 samples sequenced (1 excluded after QC)
- Resistant line BER: CK (control), CM (metronidazole), plus AK/AM (anaerobic, excluded from main analysis)
- Sensitive lines: 2, 8, 24, 40, 41 — CK and CM
- Reads aligned to the Giardia intestinalis A2 reference genome (93 - 97% mapping)
- Gene quantification performed with FeatureCounts
- Main contrasts: CK vs CM within and between lines

Data location:
All input data are in the experimental_data/ folder (count matrices, metadata, genome annotation, and QC reports). 
Incorrect SEQme analyses are included for reference only (DO NOT USE). 
Raw FASTQ/BAM files are stored externally.

Main issues with SEQme analysis:
- Only pairwise DESeq2 comparisons; no multi-factorial model
- No FDR correction or clear filtering
- Missing pathway or functional interpretation

Required re-analysis:
Re-analyze RNA-seq data using an integrative, multi-layer pipeline combining statistical rigor and biological interpretation.

1. Differential expression
- Multi-factorial model: phenotype (resistant vs sensitive), treatment (control vs metronidazole), and interaction
- Identify constitutive resistance (BER vs sensitive baseline)
- Separate drug-induced vs resistance-specific effects
- Control for variability among sensitive strains
- Apply FDR-adjusted thresholds and meaningful log2FC cutoffs

2. Functional analysis
- Perform enrichment and pathway analysis (GO, KEGG, Reactome)
- Rank candidate resistance genes for validation
- Annotate putative or uncharacterized genes linked to resistance

3. Integrative and exploratory analysis
- Use co-expression or network clustering to find gene modules
- Apply AI-assisted prediction for unknown gene functions (e.g., sequence, domain, or structure-based)

Deliverables:
Provide reproducible R/Python code, publication-quality visualizations (volcano plots, PCA, heatmaps, network maps), and propose new hypotheses explaining metronidazole resistance in Giardia intestinalis.
 
Design a transcriptomic analysis plan to identify genes specifically linked to metronidazole resistance in the BER line of Giardia intestinalis. Clearly distinguish resistance-specific effects from general drug responses and baseline strain differences. Propose a statistical model (e.g. with interaction terms) to detect these effects. Prioritize candidate resistance genes for validation and link them to biological functions using functional annotation tools. Include an approach for analyzing uncharacterized (putative) proteins.

As a reminder, here are the agenda questions that must be answered:

1. What is the most effective approach to identify genes linked to metronidazole resistance in *Giardia intestinalis*?

2. How can resistance-specific expression be separated from general drug response and baseline differences between strains?

3. Is a simple comparison sufficient, or is a complex statistical model needed? Why?

4. How should candidate genes be functionally annotated and connected to biological pathways?

5. What strategy can identify and characterize putative (unannotated) proteins among the candidate genes?

6. Are any additional files, metadata, or annotations needed to perform the analysis effectively?

Your summary should take the following form.
