## User

This is the beginning of a team meeting to discuss your research project. This is a meeting with the team lead, Principal Investigator, and the following team members: Bioinformatics Specialist, Parasitology Expert, Computational Biologist, Software Developer.

Here is the agenda for the meeting:




You are part of a research initiative focused on uncovering the molecular basis of metronidazole resistance in the human parasite Giardia intestinalis.

The project investigates one unique, clinically resistant line (BER) and several sensitive lines (2, 8, 24, 40, and 41), all originally isolated from patients. 
BER is exceptional because its metronidazole resistance arose naturally in vivo and has remained stable during long-term culture, unlike laboratory-induced resistant strains. 
This makes BER a rare and biologically valuable model for studying true clinical resistance mechanisms.

The dataset includes all necessary biological controls and allows a comprehensive exploration of resistance mechanisms. 
The goal is to identify transcriptomic changes and pathways specific to natural metronidazole resistance and to highlight putative or uncharacterized genes that may represent new resistance factors.

Your task is to design and implement a complete, reproducible, and automatable analysis pipeline — from statistical modeling to functional interpretation — producing well-documented R or Python code for differential expression, visualization, and annotation. 
You may also apply modern computational tools (e.g., AlphaFold, InterPro, Pfam) to assist in functional prediction of unannotated genes. 
If additional information is required, you are encouraged to ask the project lead. Collaboration and clear reasoning are preferred.



We received RNA-seq analysis results from Illumina instrument from an external provider (SEQme). Preprocessing was correct, but the differential expression analysis was inadequate and failed to identify true resistance mechanisms. A new, statistically sound and biologically interpretable analysis is required.

Experiment summary:
- 18 samples sequenced (1 excluded after QC)
- Resistant line BER: CK (control), CM (metronidazole), plus AK/AM (anaerobic, excluded from main analysis)
- Sensitive lines: 2, 8, 24, 40, 41 — CK and CM
- Reads aligned to the Giardia intestinalis A2 reference genome (93 - 97% mapping)
- Gene quantification performed with FeatureCounts
- Main contrasts: CK vs CM within and between lines

Data location:
All input data are in the experimental_data/ folder (count matrices, metadata, genome annotation, and QC reports). 
Incorrect SEQme analyses are included for reference only (DO NOT USE). 
Raw FASTQ/BAM files are stored externally.

Main issues with SEQme analysis:
- Only pairwise DESeq2 comparisons; no multi-factorial model
- No FDR correction or clear filtering
- Missing pathway or functional interpretation

Required re-analysis:
Re-analyze RNA-seq data using an integrative, multi-layer pipeline combining statistical rigor and biological interpretation.

1. Differential expression
- Multi-factorial model: phenotype (resistant vs sensitive), treatment (control vs metronidazole), and interaction
- Identify constitutive resistance (BER vs sensitive baseline)
- Separate drug-induced vs resistance-specific effects
- Control for variability among sensitive strains
- Apply FDR-adjusted thresholds and meaningful log2FC cutoffs

2. Functional analysis
- Perform enrichment and pathway analysis (GO, KEGG, Reactome)
- Rank candidate resistance genes for validation
- Annotate putative or uncharacterized genes linked to resistance

3. Integrative and exploratory analysis
- Use co-expression or network clustering to find gene modules
- Apply AI-assisted prediction for unknown gene functions (e.g., sequence, domain, or structure-based)

Deliverables:
Provide reproducible R/Python code, publication-quality visualizations (volcano plots, PCA, heatmaps, network maps), and propose new hypotheses explaining metronidazole resistance in Giardia intestinalis.
 
Design a transcriptomic analysis plan to identify genes specifically linked to metronidazole resistance in the BER line of Giardia intestinalis. Clearly distinguish resistance-specific effects from general drug responses and baseline strain differences. Propose a statistical model (e.g. with interaction terms) to detect these effects. Prioritize candidate resistance genes for validation and link them to biological functions using functional annotation tools. Include an approach for analyzing uncharacterized (putative) proteins.

Here are the agenda questions that must be answered:

1. What is the most effective approach to identify genes linked to metronidazole resistance in *Giardia intestinalis*?

2. How can resistance-specific expression be separated from general drug response and baseline differences between strains?

3. Is a simple comparison sufficient, or is a complex statistical model needed? Why?

4. How should candidate genes be functionally annotated and connected to biological pathways?

5. What strategy can identify and characterize putative (unannotated) proteins among the candidate genes?

6. Are any additional files, metadata, or annotations needed to perform the analysis effectively?

Principal Investigator will convene the meeting. Then, each team member will provide their thoughts on the discussion one-by-one in the order above. After all team members have given their input, Principal Investigator will synthesize the points raised by each team member, make decisions regarding the agenda based on team member input, and ask follow-up questions to gather more information and feedback about how to better address the agenda. This will continue for 3 rounds. Once the discussion is complete, Principal Investigator will summarize the meeting in detail for future discussions, provide a specific recommendation regarding the agenda, and answer the agenda questions (if any) based on the discussion while strictly adhering to the agenda rules (if any).

## User

## Principal Investigator

As we begin this meeting, I want to acknowledge the significance of our research into metronidazole resistance in *Giardia intestinalis*, particularly focusing on the unique BER strain. Given the challenges with the initial analysis from SEQme, our goal is to design a robust pipeline that not only identifies true resistance mechanisms but also ensures our findings are reproducible and interpretable.

To effectively guide our discussion, I would like us to consider the following questions as we proceed:

1. **Multi-factorial Analysis**: How can we best incorporate a model that accounts for various factors such as phenotype, treatment, and their interactions? Are there specific statistical frameworks or software packages that you recommend?

2. **Biological Interpretation**: Once identified, how do we ensure that the genes linked to resistance are contextualized within biological pathways? What resources can we leverage for pathway analysis?

3. **Characterization of Unannotated Proteins**: What are our options for predicting functions of putative proteins, and how might AI tools like AlphaFold enhance our understanding?

4. **Data Completeness**: Do we have all the necessary data at hand, or are there gaps that need to be filled before we can conduct a thorough analysis?

5. **Visualization and Documentation**: What are best practices for creating visualizations that effectively communicate our findings and ensuring that our code is well-documented for reproducibility?

Let's ensure that each team member has the opportunity to contribute their expertise on these points. I’m particularly interested in how we can leverage our interdisciplinary strengths to produce a comprehensive and insightful analysis. 

I look forward to your insights and recommendations. Let's start with the Bioinformatics Specialist.

## User

Bioinformatics Specialist, please provide your thoughts on the discussion (round 1 of 3). If you do not have anything new or relevant to add, you may say "pass". Remember that you can and should (politely) disagree with other team members if you have a different perspective.

## Bioinformatics Specialist

Thank you, Principal Investigator. Here are my thoughts on the agenda:

1. **Multi-factorial Analysis**: To effectively identify genes linked to metronidazole resistance, we need to employ a multi-factorial statistical model. I recommend using DESeq2 or edgeR, which can handle complex experimental designs. We'll define factors such as phenotype (resistant vs. sensitive), treatment (control vs. metronidazole), and their interaction. This will allow us to separate the specific effects of resistance from general drug responses and baseline differences across strains.

2. **Biological Interpretation**: For functional annotation and pathway analysis, tools like GO, KEGG, and Reactome are essential. These will help us connect differentially expressed genes to biological pathways. Incorporating enrichment analysis will further highlight pathways that are significantly impacted in the resistant line.

3. **Characterization of Unannotated Proteins**: We should utilize AI-assisted tools such as AlphaFold for protein structure prediction and InterPro or Pfam for domain annotation. These tools can provide insights into the potential functions of uncharacterized proteins, thereby expanding our understanding of resistance mechanisms.

4. **Data Completeness**: We need to ensure that our metadata is comprehensive and accurately reflects the experimental conditions. This includes verifying that all relevant contrasts and batch effects are accounted for. If any additional annotations or metadata are missing, we need to address these gaps promptly.

5. **Visualization and Documentation**: For effective communication, high-quality visualizations such as volcano plots, PCA, and heatmaps are crucial. These will aid in interpreting the results and sharing our findings with the broader community. Ensuring our code is well-documented is non-negotiable to facilitate reproducibility and transparency.

I believe addressing these points will set a strong foundation for uncovering the molecular basis of metronidazole resistance in *Giardia intestinalis*. I look forward to hearing the team's input and refining our approach accordingly.

## User

Parasitology Expert, please provide your thoughts on the discussion (round 1 of 3). If you do not have anything new or relevant to add, you may say "pass". Remember that you can and should (politely) disagree with other team members if you have a different perspective.

## Parasitology Expert

Thank you for the opportunity to contribute. Here's my perspective as the Parasitology Expert:

1. **Multi-factorial Analysis**: I agree with the Bioinformatics Specialist on using a multi-factorial model. It's crucial to dissect not just the direct resistance mechanisms but also how resistance interacts with the parasite's natural biology. This understanding can help differentiate between genes involved in innate resistance and those that are part of a general stress response to metronidazole.

2. **Biological Interpretation**: From a biological standpoint, it’s important that the genes identified are not only statistically significant but also have a plausible link to known resistance mechanisms in *Giardia*. For instance, exploring changes in energy metabolism pathways or oxidative stress responses could be highly relevant, given metronidazole's mechanism of action. Tools like KEGG can be particularly useful here to map out pathways.

3. **Characterization of Unannotated Proteins**: It's important to consider that *Giardia* has a significant number of gene products without clear functions. AI tools like AlphaFold can offer structural predictions, but we should also consider experimental validation for promising candidates. Exploring homology with known resistance proteins in other protozoans could provide additional insights.

4. **Data Completeness**: I would emphasize ensuring that our biological replicates are well-documented and that we understand the baseline variability among the sensitive lines. This will help us accurately interpret the differential expression results and ensure that what we are observing is truly related to resistance.

5. **Visualization and Documentation**: From a parasitological perspective, visualizing how differentially expressed genes cluster in terms of biological processes or cellular components could offer insights into the physiological changes associated with resistance. This is especially useful in communicating findings to both scientific and clinical audiences.

Overall, it is critical that we maintain a strong link between the transcriptomic data and the biological context of metronidazole resistance. I look forward to the Computational Biologist’s insights, especially regarding the integration of computational predictions with biological data.

## Computational Biologist

Thank you for the opportunity to add my perspective as a Computational Biologist. Here's how I see our approach unfolding:

1. **Multi-factorial Analysis**: Building on what the Bioinformatics Specialist and Parasitology Expert said, I strongly support using a multi-factorial model within DESeq2 or edgeR. This approach is crucial for separating direct resistance effects from general drug responses and baseline strain variability. Including interaction terms will help us discern how resistance manifests under metronidazole treatment specifically.

2. **Biological Interpretation**: To truly capture the functional implications of our findings, it is essential to integrate pathway analysis with structural data. Tools like Reactome and KEGG will help map the pathways, but we should also consider using network-based approaches to visualize how these genes interact at the molecular level. This could reveal central nodes or hubs that play pivotal roles in resistance.

3. **Characterization of Unannotated Proteins**: For putative proteins, leveraging AI tools such as AlphaFold for structure prediction and combining these with InterPro and Pfam for domain and motif analysis will be invaluable. Additionally, integrating comparative genomics approaches can provide clues from evolutionary conservation. This will be especially helpful in inferring potential functions for these proteins within the context of resistance.

4. **Data Completeness**: Ensuring we have a comprehensive set of metadata is critical, particularly for accurately modeling and adjusting for batch effects or technical variances. If any genomic annotations or protein sequences are missing, we should prioritize acquiring these to maintain the integrity of our predictions.

5. **Visualization and Documentation**: It's vital to follow best practices for visualization, ensuring that our plots are not only informative but also intuitive. Documenting our computational pipeline with clear annotations will aid in reproducibility and allow others to build on our work.

Ultimately, integrating structural and functional predictions with differential expression data will enable us to derive a holistic view of the resistance mechanisms in *Giardia intestinalis*. This interdisciplinary approach will be key in identifying novel resistance factors and forming new hypotheses for validation. I look forward to discussing how we can apply these strategies effectively with the rest of the team.

Computational Biologist, please provide your thoughts on the discussion (round 2 of 3). If you do not have anything new or relevant to add, you may say "pass". Remember that you can and should (politely) disagree with other team members if you have a different perspective.

## Computational Biologist

Thank you, Principal Investigator. I'm pleased with the collaborative direction our discussions are taking. Here are a few thoughts to further refine our approach:

1. **Criteria for Candidate Selection**: To complement the suggestions made, I propose using network-based approaches to identify hub genes or central nodes in our differentially expressed gene set. By constructing a co-expression network, we can identify genes that play critical roles in resistance pathways, even if they don't show the highest fold changes individually. This could guide our selection of unannotated proteins for further analysis.

2. **Functional Prediction and Validation**: While AI tools like AlphaFold will help predict structures, I suggest we also consider functional prediction tools that can assess protein-protein interactions. Tools like STRING could offer insights into potential interactions with known resistance factors, aiding in the functional annotation of putative proteins.

3. **Integrating Comparative Genomics**: In line with our strategy for unannotated proteins, we should leverage comparative genomics to gather evolutionary clues. By comparing our candidates to orthologous genes in closely related species, we might infer function based on conservation and divergence patterns. This could provide a genomic context to link candidates to known biological processes.

4. **Data Completeness**: Ensuring our metadata captures the full experimental context is crucial. If genomic annotations are incomplete, consider using tools like NCBI's Gene or UniProt to fill in the gaps where possible.

5. **Visualization**: Network maps that display the interconnectedness of differentially expressed genes could add a layer of understanding to our results. These visualizations can highlight how our candidate genes integrate into broader resistance mechanisms.

By continuing to integrate structural, functional, and network-based data, we can derive a comprehensive view of metronidazole resistance. I look forward to aligning these computational strategies with the insights from our biological data. Thank you.

We can automate network analysis using packages like igraph or networkx in Python. This will allow us to visualize gene interactions and adapt our pipeline to include network-based metrics as part of the candidate selection process.

3. **Metadata Management**: I propose creating a structured YAML or JSON configuration file that specifies all metadata, experimental conditions, and analysis parameters. This will not only streamline the loading and processing of data but also enhance documentation and reproducibility across different runs.

4. **Visualization Tools**: To ensure clarity and consistency in visualizations, we should standardize on tools like ggplot2 in R or seaborn in Python for all plots. Coupling these with RMarkdown or Jupyter Notebooks will allow us to produce cohesive and well-documented reports, integrating both the visual and narrative aspects of our analysis.

5. **Version Control and Collaboration**: Utilizing platforms like GitHub for version control will be crucial in managing changes and facilitating collaboration among team members. This will allow us to track all modifications and ensure that everyone is working with the most up-to-date version of the pipeline.

Overall, my focus will be on ensuring that our pipeline is not only robust and reproducible but also flexible enough to adapt to any new insights or data that may arise. I'm looking forward to implementing these strategies with the team and ensuring our analysis is both efficient and insightful. Thank you.

## User

Principal Investigator, please summarize the meeting in detail for future discussions, provide a specific recommendation regarding the agenda, and answer the agenda questions (if any) based on the discussion while strictly adhering to the agenda rules (if any).

As a reminder, here is the agenda for the meeting:




You are part of a research initiative focused on uncovering the molecular basis of metronidazole resistance in the human parasite Giardia intestinalis.

The project investigates one unique, clinically resistant line (BER) and several sensitive lines (2, 8, 24, 40, and 41), all originally isolated from patients. 
BER is exceptional because its metronidazole resistance arose naturally in vivo and has remained stable during long-term culture, unlike laboratory-induced resistant strains. 
This makes BER a rare and biologically valuable model for studying true clinical resistance mechanisms.

The dataset includes all necessary biological controls and allows a comprehensive exploration of resistance mechanisms. 
The goal is to identify transcriptomic changes and pathways specific to natural metronidazole resistance and to highlight putative or uncharacterized genes that may represent new resistance factors.

Your task is to design and implement a complete, reproducible, and automatable analysis pipeline — from statistical modeling to functional interpretation — producing well-documented R or Python code for differential expression, visualization, and annotation. 
You may also apply modern computational tools (e.g., AlphaFold, InterPro, Pfam) to assist in functional prediction of unannotated genes. 
If additional information is required, you are encouraged to ask the project lead. Collaboration and clear reasoning are preferred.



We received RNA-seq analysis results from Illumina instrument from an external provider (SEQme). Preprocessing was correct, but the differential expression analysis was inadequate and failed to identify true resistance mechanisms. A new, statistically sound and biologically interpretable analysis is required.

Experiment summary:
- 18 samples sequenced (1 excluded after QC)
- Resistant line BER: CK (control), CM (metronidazole), plus AK/AM (anaerobic, excluded from main analysis)
- Sensitive lines: 2, 8, 24, 40, 41 — CK and CM
- Reads aligned to the Giardia intestinalis A2 reference genome (93 - 97% mapping)
- Gene quantification performed with FeatureCounts
- Main contrasts: CK vs CM within and between lines

Data location:
All input data are in the experimental_data/ folder (count matrices, metadata, genome annotation, and QC reports). 
Incorrect SEQme analyses are included for reference only (DO NOT USE). 
Raw FASTQ/BAM files are stored externally.

Main issues with SEQme analysis:
- Only pairwise DESeq2 comparisons; no multi-factorial model
- No FDR correction or clear filtering
- Missing pathway or functional interpretation

Required re-analysis:
Re-analyze RNA-seq data using an integrative, multi-layer pipeline combining statistical rigor and biological interpretation.

1. Differential expression
- Multi-factorial model: phenotype (resistant vs sensitive), treatment (control vs metronidazole), and interaction
- Identify constitutive resistance (BER vs sensitive baseline)
- Separate drug-induced vs resistance-specific effects
- Control for variability among sensitive strains
- Apply FDR-adjusted thresholds and meaningful log2FC cutoffs

2. Functional analysis
- Perform enrichment and pathway analysis (GO, KEGG, Reactome)
- Rank candidate resistance genes for validation
- Annotate putative or uncharacterized genes linked to resistance

3. Integrative and exploratory analysis
- Use co-expression or network clustering to find gene modules
- Apply AI-assisted prediction for unknown gene functions (e.g., sequence, domain, or structure-based)

Deliverables:
Provide reproducible R/Python code, publication-quality visualizations (volcano plots, PCA, heatmaps, network maps), and propose new hypotheses explaining metronidazole resistance in Giardia intestinalis.
 
Design a transcriptomic analysis plan to identify genes specifically linked to metronidazole resistance in the BER line of Giardia intestinalis. Clearly distinguish resistance-specific effects from general drug responses and baseline strain differences. Propose a statistical model (e.g. with interaction terms) to detect these effects. Prioritize candidate resistance genes for validation and link them to biological functions using functional annotation tools. Include an approach for analyzing uncharacterized (putative) proteins.

As a reminder, here are the agenda questions that must be answered:

1. What is the most effective approach to identify genes linked to metronidazole resistance in *Giardia intestinalis*?

2. How can resistance-specific expression be separated from general drug response and baseline differences between strains?

3. Is a simple comparison sufficient, or is a complex statistical model needed? Why?

4. How should candidate genes be functionally annotated and connected to biological pathways?

5. What strategy can identify and characterize putative (unannotated) proteins among the candidate genes?

6. Are any additional files, metadata, or annotations needed to perform the analysis effectively?

Your summary should take the following form.

### Agenda

Our primary objective is to develop a robust and reproducible analysis pipeline for understanding the molecular basis of metronidazole resistance in *Giardia intestinalis*. This involves re-analyzing RNA-seq data with a focus on the unique resistant BER line and identifying transcriptomic changes that are specific to resistance. The aim is to differentiate resistance-specific effects from general drug responses and baseline strain differences, using a comprehensive statistical analysis framework. Additionally, we need to prioritize candidate resistance genes for functional annotation and explore strategies to characterize putative proteins.
