Here is the agenda for the meeting:

Please read the summaries of multiple separate meetings about the same agenda. Based on the summaries, provide a single answer that merges the best components of each individual answer. Please use the same format as the individual answers. Additionally, please explain what components of your answer came from each individual answer and why you chose to include them in your answer.

As a reference, here is the agenda from those meetings, which must be addressed here as well:




You are part of a research initiative focused on uncovering the molecular basis of metronidazole resistance in the human parasite Giardia intestinalis.

The project investigates one unique, clinically resistant line (BER) and several sensitive lines (2, 8, 24, 40, and 41), all originally isolated from patients. 
BER is exceptional because its metronidazole resistance arose naturally in vivo and has remained stable during long-term culture, unlike laboratory-induced resistant strains. 
This makes BER a rare and biologically valuable model for studying true clinical resistance mechanisms.

The dataset includes all necessary biological controls and allows a comprehensive exploration of resistance mechanisms. 
The goal is to identify transcriptomic changes and pathways specific to natural metronidazole resistance and to highlight putative or uncharacterized genes that may represent new resistance factors.

Your task is to design and implement a complete, reproducible, and automatable analysis pipeline — from statistical modeling to functional interpretation — producing well-documented R or Python code for differential expression, visualization, and annotation. 
You may also apply modern computational tools (e.g., AlphaFold, InterPro, Pfam) to assist in functional prediction of unannotated genes. 
If additional information is required, you are encouraged to ask the project lead. Collaboration and clear reasoning are preferred.



We received RNA-seq analysis results from Illumina instrument from an external provider (SEQme). Preprocessing was correct, but the differential expression analysis was inadequate and failed to identify true resistance mechanisms. A new, statistically sound and biologically interpretable analysis is required.

Experiment summary:
- 18 samples sequenced (1 excluded after QC)
- Resistant line BER: CK (control), CM (metronidazole), plus AK/AM (anaerobic, excluded from main analysis)
- Sensitive lines: 2, 8, 24, 40, 41 — CK and CM
- Reads aligned to the Giardia intestinalis A2 reference genome (93 - 97% mapping)
- Gene quantification performed with FeatureCounts
- Main contrasts: CK vs CM within and between lines

Data location:
All input data are in the experimental_data/ folder (count matrices, metadata, genome annotation, and QC reports). 
Incorrect SEQme analyses are included for reference only (DO NOT USE). 
Raw FASTQ/BAM files are stored externally.

Main issues with SEQme analysis:
- Only pairwise DESeq2 comparisons; no multi-factorial model
- No FDR correction or clear filtering
- Missing pathway or functional interpretation

Required re-analysis:
Re-analyze RNA-seq data using an integrative, multi-layer pipeline combining statistical rigor and biological interpretation.

1. Differential expression
- Multi-factorial model: phenotype (resistant vs sensitive), treatment (control vs metronidazole), and interaction
- Identify constitutive resistance (BER vs sensitive baseline)
- Separate drug-induced vs resistance-specific effects
- Control for variability among sensitive strains
- Apply FDR-adjusted thresholds and meaningful log2FC cutoffs

2. Functional analysis
- Perform enrichment and pathway analysis (GO, KEGG, Reactome)
- Rank candidate resistance genes for validation
- Annotate putative or uncharacterized genes linked to resistance

3. Integrative and exploratory analysis
- Use co-expression or network clustering to find gene modules
- Apply AI-assisted prediction for unknown gene functions (e.g., sequence, domain, or structure-based)

Deliverables:
Provide reproducible R/Python code, publication-quality visualizations (volcano plots, PCA, heatmaps, network maps), and propose new hypotheses explaining metronidazole resistance in Giardia intestinalis.
 
Design a transcriptomic analysis plan to identify genes specifically linked to metronidazole resistance in the BER line of Giardia intestinalis. Clearly distinguish resistance-specific effects from general drug responses and baseline strain differences. Propose a statistical model (e.g. with interaction terms) to detect these effects. Prioritize candidate resistance genes for validation and link them to biological functions using functional annotation tools. Include an approach for analyzing uncharacterized (putative) proteins.

As a reference, here are the agenda questions from those meetings, which must be answered here as well:

1. What is the most effective approach to identify genes linked to metronidazole resistance in *Giardia intestinalis*?

2. How can resistance-specific expression be separated from general drug response and baseline differences between strains?

3. Is a simple comparison sufficient, or is a complex statistical model needed? Why?

4. How should candidate genes be functionally annotated and connected to biological pathways?

5. What strategy can identify and characterize putative (unannotated) proteins among the candidate genes?

6. Are any additional files, metadata, or annotations needed to perform the analysis effectively?

### Revised Agenda Response

Our research initiative aims to uncover the molecular mechanisms underlying metronidazole resistance in *Giardia intestinalis*, focusing on the clinically resistant BER line. The objective is to design a comprehensive, reproducible analysis pipeline using multi-factorial models, functional annotation, and modern computational tools to identify and validate resistance-specific genes. This will involve separating resistance-specific expression from general drug responses and baseline differences, annotating candidate genes, and proposing a strategy for characterizing unannotated proteins.

### Improved Integrated Answer

1. **What is the most effective approach to identify genes linked to metronidazole resistance in *Giardia intestinalis*?**

   **Answer:** Implement a multi-factorial statistical model using DESeq2, incorporating phenotype (resistant vs. sensitive), treatment (control vs. metronidazole), and interaction terms. This model will specifically include contrasts such as BER control vs. sensitive control and BER metronidazole vs. sensitive metronidazole to capture resistance-specific effects. Complement this with machine learning for pattern recognition and network analysis for exploratory insights.

   **Justification:** By explicitly defining contrasts, we can better isolate resistance-specific effects, as highlighted in summaries 1 and 2. This approach ensures a comprehensive understanding of resistance-specific effects, adapting to complex data structures and capturing interaction effects specific to resistance.

2. **How can resistance-specific expression be separated from general drug response and baseline differences between strains?**

   **Answer:** Use interaction terms in the statistical model to distinguish between resistance-specific and general drug-induced effects. Apply surrogate variable analysis (SVA) to control for variability among sensitive strains, particularly focusing on batch effects and other confounding variables.

   **Justification:** Interaction terms and SVA, as emphasized in summaries 1 and 2, provide a nuanced view of how different factors contribute to gene expression changes, ensuring precise identification of key genes. SVA will be integrated during the preprocessing stage to adjust for hidden batch effects.

3. **Is a simple comparison sufficient, or is a complex statistical model needed? Why?**

   **Answer:** A complex statistical model is needed.

   **Justification:** The dataset's complexity, including multiple phenotypes and treatments, necessitates a sophisticated model to capture subtle expression changes and interactions, as noted in all summaries. This model will address potential confounding variables such as strain-specific baseline differences and treatment effects.

4. **How should candidate genes be functionally annotated and connected to biological pathways?**

   **Answer:** Utilize tools like InterPro, Pfam, KEGG, and GO for enrichment analysis, integrated into the pipeline. Specifically, we will use these tools to map genes to known resistance pathways and identify novel pathways potentially involved in resistance.

   **Justification:** These tools, recommended in summaries 3 and 5, provide comprehensive insights into gene functions and their roles in biological pathways, enhancing the functional context of candidate genes. The workflow will include automated retrieval and visualization of pathway data.

5. **What strategy can identify and characterize putative (unannotated) proteins among the candidate genes?**

   **Answer:** Apply AI-assisted tools like AlphaFold for structural predictions and network analysis for functional predictions. Use a scoring system based on expression, connectivity, and evolutionary conservation to prioritize proteins for further study.

   **Justification:** These methods, suggested in summaries 2 and 5, provide structural and functional context, essential for hypothesizing roles of unannotated proteins and prioritizing them for further study. The scoring system will weigh factors such as differential expression magnitude, network centrality, and conservation across species.

6. **Are any additional files, metadata, or annotations needed to perform the analysis effectively?**

   **Answer:** Ensure comprehensive metadata on experimental conditions, phenotypic resistance data, and access to relevant pathway databases like EuPathDB. This includes fields such as sample origin, sequencing batch, and treatment conditions.

   **Justification:** As noted in summaries 3 and 5, complete and accurate metadata is crucial for robust statistical modeling and contextual interpretation of results. We will implement a standardized metadata template to ensure consistency.

### Next Steps

1. **Develop the Analysis Pipeline:** Begin implementation of the modular and scalable pipeline using Snakemake or Nextflow, integrating statistical, machine learning, and functional annotation tools. Clearly define each step and its purpose in the pipeline documentation.

2. **Enhance User Interfaces:** Design and implement user-friendly dashboards for data exploration using R Shiny or Python Dash, ensuring accessibility for all team members.

3. **Engage in Experimental Validation:** Collaborate with parasitology experts to plan and conduct validation experiments, incorporating their results into the pipeline to refine computational models.

4. **Regular Checkpoints:** Establish regular team meetings to review progress, share insights, and iteratively refine the analysis based on feedback and new data.

5. **Training Workshops:** Conduct sessions to familiarize the team with new tools and methods, ensuring all members are equipped to contribute effectively to the analysis.

By addressing the feedback, this revised response provides a more detailed, actionable, and aligned plan with the project's objectives, ensuring a thorough, reproducible, and biologically meaningful analysis.
