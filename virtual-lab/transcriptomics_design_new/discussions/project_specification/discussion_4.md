## User

This is the beginning of a team meeting to discuss your research project. This is a meeting with the team lead, Principal Investigator, and the following team members: Bioinformatics Specialist, Parasitology Expert, Computational Biologist, Software Developer.

Here is the agenda for the meeting:




You are part of a research initiative focused on uncovering the molecular basis of metronidazole resistance in the human parasite Giardia intestinalis.

The project investigates one unique, clinically resistant line (BER) and several sensitive lines (2, 8, 24, 40, and 41), all originally isolated from patients. 
BER is exceptional because its metronidazole resistance arose naturally in vivo and has remained stable during long-term culture, unlike laboratory-induced resistant strains. 
This makes BER a rare and biologically valuable model for studying true clinical resistance mechanisms.

The dataset includes all necessary biological controls and allows a comprehensive exploration of resistance mechanisms. 
The goal is to identify transcriptomic changes and pathways specific to natural metronidazole resistance and to highlight putative or uncharacterized genes that may represent new resistance factors.

Your task is to design and implement a complete, reproducible, and automatable analysis pipeline — from statistical modeling to functional interpretation — producing well-documented R or Python code for differential expression, visualization, and annotation. 
You may also apply modern computational tools (e.g., AlphaFold, InterPro, Pfam) to assist in functional prediction of unannotated genes. 
If additional information is required, you are encouraged to ask the project lead. Collaboration and clear reasoning are preferred.



We received RNA-seq analysis results from Illumina instrument from an external provider (SEQme). Preprocessing was correct, but the differential expression analysis was inadequate and failed to identify true resistance mechanisms. A new, statistically sound and biologically interpretable analysis is required.

Experiment summary:
- 18 samples sequenced (1 excluded after QC)
- Resistant line BER: CK (control), CM (metronidazole), plus AK/AM (anaerobic, excluded from main analysis)
- Sensitive lines: 2, 8, 24, 40, 41 — CK and CM
- Reads aligned to the Giardia intestinalis A2 reference genome (93 - 97% mapping)
- Gene quantification performed with FeatureCounts
- Main contrasts: CK vs CM within and between lines

Data location:
All input data are in the experimental_data/ folder (count matrices, metadata, genome annotation, and QC reports). 
Incorrect SEQme analyses are included for reference only (DO NOT USE). 
Raw FASTQ/BAM files are stored externally.

Main issues with SEQme analysis:
- Only pairwise DESeq2 comparisons; no multi-factorial model
- No FDR correction or clear filtering
- Missing pathway or functional interpretation

Required re-analysis:
Re-analyze RNA-seq data using an integrative, multi-layer pipeline combining statistical rigor and biological interpretation.

1. Differential expression
- Multi-factorial model: phenotype (resistant vs sensitive), treatment (control vs metronidazole), and interaction
- Identify constitutive resistance (BER vs sensitive baseline)
- Separate drug-induced vs resistance-specific effects
- Control for variability among sensitive strains
- Apply FDR-adjusted thresholds and meaningful log2FC cutoffs

2. Functional analysis
- Perform enrichment and pathway analysis (GO, KEGG, Reactome)
- Rank candidate resistance genes for validation
- Annotate putative or uncharacterized genes linked to resistance

3. Integrative and exploratory analysis
- Use co-expression or network clustering to find gene modules
- Apply AI-assisted prediction for unknown gene functions (e.g., sequence, domain, or structure-based)

Deliverables:
Provide reproducible R/Python code, publication-quality visualizations (volcano plots, PCA, heatmaps, network maps), and propose new hypotheses explaining metronidazole resistance in Giardia intestinalis.
 
Design a transcriptomic analysis plan to identify genes specifically linked to metronidazole resistance in the BER line of Giardia intestinalis. Clearly distinguish resistance-specific effects from general drug responses and baseline strain differences. Propose a statistical model (e.g. with interaction terms) to detect these effects. Prioritize candidate resistance genes for validation and link them to biological functions using functional annotation tools. Include an approach for analyzing uncharacterized (putative) proteins.

Here are the agenda questions that must be answered:

1. What is the most effective approach to identify genes linked to metronidazole resistance in *Giardia intestinalis*?

2. How can resistance-specific expression be separated from general drug response and baseline differences between strains?

3. Is a simple comparison sufficient, or is a complex statistical model needed? Why?

4. How should candidate genes be functionally annotated and connected to biological pathways?

5. What strategy can identify and characterize putative (unannotated) proteins among the candidate genes?

6. Are any additional files, metadata, or annotations needed to perform the analysis effectively?

Principal Investigator will convene the meeting. Then, each team member will provide their thoughts on the discussion one-by-one in the order above. After all team members have given their input, Principal Investigator will synthesize the points raised by each team member, make decisions regarding the agenda based on team member input, and ask follow-up questions to gather more information and feedback about how to better address the agenda. This will continue for 3 rounds. Once the discussion is complete, Principal Investigator will summarize the meeting in detail for future discussions, provide a specific recommendation regarding the agenda, and answer the agenda questions (if any) based on the discussion while strictly adhering to the agenda rules (if any).

## User

Principal Investigator, please provide your initial thoughts on the agenda as well as any questions you have to guide the discussion among the team members.

## Principal Investigator

Thank you, everyone, for joining this meeting to discuss our research initiative on metronidazole resistance in *Giardia intestinalis*. This is an exciting and challenging project, given the unique nature of the BER line, and I'm looking forward to hearing your insights.

To begin, our primary goal is to design an effective and comprehensive analysis plan to identify genes linked specifically to metronidazole resistance in the BER line. Our agenda is clear, and I believe we're well-positioned to address each point methodically. Let's ensure our discussion remains focused and productive, so we can make informed decisions and move forward with our analysis.

Here are some guiding questions for our discussion:

1. **On identifying resistance-linked genes:** Given the complexity of our data, what strategies or computational tools should we prioritize to ensure we identify genes truly linked to resistance, rather than those merely associated with drug exposure or baseline differences between strains?

2. **On separating resistance-specific expression:** How can we refine our statistical model to distinguish between drug-induced effects and those genuinely associated with the resistance phenotype?

3. **On the adequacy of statistical modeling:** Considering the limitations of the initial analysis, should we develop a more complex statistical model with interaction terms, and how can we justify the additional complexity?

4. **On functional annotation:** What tools and databases should we integrate to annotate candidate resistance genes effectively and connect them to relevant biological pathways?

5. **On characterizing putative proteins:** How can we leverage AI-assisted prediction tools to identify functions of unannotated proteins, and what criteria should guide the prioritization of these proteins for further study?

6. **On additional data needs:** Do we have all necessary datasets and metadata, or is there further information we should gather to optimize our analysis?

I look forward to hearing each of your perspectives on these questions. Let's aim for a collaborative discussion that will help us refine our approach and ensure our findings are robust and biologically meaningful. Bioinformatics Specialist, please start us off with your thoughts.

## User

Bioinformatics Specialist, please provide your thoughts on the discussion (round 1 of 3). If you do not have anything new or relevant to add, you may say "pass". Remember that you can and should (politely) disagree with other team members if you have a different perspective.

## Bioinformatics Specialist

Thank you, Principal Investigator. I appreciate the opportunity to share my perspective on this project. 

1. **Identifying resistance-linked genes:** For this, I suggest employing a multi-factorial differential expression model that accounts for phenotype (resistant vs. sensitive), treatment (control vs. metronidazole), and their interaction. This approach will help parse out resistance-specific effects from general treatment effects and baseline differences among strains.

2. **Separating resistance-specific expression:** Using interaction terms in our statistical modeling is crucial. These terms will help us capture the unique gene expression patterns associated specifically with resistance, beyond what is induced by metronidazole exposure alone.

3. **Statistical modeling complexity:** A simple pairwise comparison is not sufficient given the complexity of our dataset. A complex model is justified as it allows us to control for confounding variables and extract meaningful biological insights, especially when dealing with multiple sensitive lines and one resistant line.

4. **Functional annotation:** For functional annotation, I recommend using a combination of tools such as InterPro, Pfam, and KEGG. These resources can help us map genes to pathways and identify potential resistance mechanisms. Additionally, we should consider pathway enrichment analyses using tools like GO and Reactome to provide a broader biological context.

5. **Characterizing putative proteins:** To explore unannotated proteins, AI-assisted tools like AlphaFold can provide structural predictions. This, combined with domain-based approaches from InterPro, can lend insight into potential functions, helping us prioritize candidates for experimental validation.

6. **Additional data needs:** We must ensure that our metadata is complete, especially regarding experimental conditions for each sample. This will enhance the accuracy of our statistical models. If not already available, acquiring more detailed phenotypic data on each line could also be beneficial.

These strategies collectively aim to produce a robust and comprehensive analysis, allowing us to discern true resistance mechanisms. I'm eager to hear thoughts from the rest of the team.

Parasitology Expert, please provide your thoughts on the discussion (round 1 of 3). If you do not have anything new or relevant to add, you may say "pass". Remember that you can and should (politely) disagree with other team members if you have a different perspective.

## Parasitology Expert

Thank you, Bioinformatics Specialist, for your detailed insights. I agree with many of your points and would like to add some context from a parasitology perspective:

1. **Identifying resistance-linked genes:** I concur that a multi-factorial model is key, but I would emphasize the importance of considering the biological relevance of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in the context of Giardia's unique metabolism and cell biology, which can be quite distinct from other eukaryotes.

2. **Separating resistance-specific expression:** In addition to statistical modeling, incorporating knowledge of Giardia's biology is crucial. For example, genes involved in oxidative stress response, as metronidazole is known to produce toxic radicals, should be scrutinized closely for their role in resistance.

3. **Statistical modeling complexity:** While complex models are necessary, they should remain interpretable. It's vital that the biological implications of interaction terms are clear, perhaps by validating findings with known resistance markers or biochemical assays.

4. **Functional annotation:** Protein function in Giardia is often inferred due to limited experimental data. Hence, integrating transcriptomic data with proteomic studies, if available, could strengthen our functional annotations. Additionally, examining orthologs in related organisms might provide evolutionary insights into gene functions.

5. **Characterizing putative proteins:** Uncharacterized genes should be prioritized for their potential role in resistance pathways. Bioinformatics predictions are helpful, but we should also consider experimental validation through gene knockdowns or overexpression studies in Giardia.

6. **Additional data needs:** I suggest verifying whether we have access to phenotypic resistance data such as growth rates or metronidazole IC50 values for the different lines. These data could contextualize transcriptomic findings and aid in identifying resistance-specific markers.

By integrating these parasitological insights into our analysis pipeline, we can better interpret DE results in a biologically meaningful way, enhancing the relevance of our findings to the field of protozoan drug resistance. I look forward to further discussions with the team.

## Computational Biologist

Thank you, Parasitology Expert, for your comprehensive input. I agree with many of the points raised and would like to expand on a few areas from a computational biology perspective:

1. **Identifying resistance-linked genes:** A multi-layered approach involving machine learning models could complement traditional statistical methods. By training models on known resistance and sensitivity patterns, we can predict additional candidates that might not emerge from statistical methods alone.

2. **Separating resistance-specific expression:** Aside from including interaction terms, dimensionality reduction techniques like PCA or t-SNE could be effective in visualizing and separating expression patterns unique to resistance. These techniques can help identify clusters of genes that behave differently under resistant vs. sensitive conditions.

3. **Statistical modeling complexity:** While complex models are important, we should ensure they remain computationally efficient given the dataset size. Regularization techniques might help in managing model complexity and preventing overfitting, especially when dealing with high-dimensional data.

4. **Functional annotation:** Beyond standard tools like InterPro and KEGG, employing network-based approaches, such as constructing gene co-expression networks, could highlight modules that correspond to resistance pathways. These networks can reveal interactions that are not immediately obvious from a linear pathway analysis.

5. **Characterizing putative proteins:** AI-assisted predictions like AlphaFold can be supplemented with docking simulations to predict potential interactions with metronidazole or its metabolites. This could provide functional clues, especially for proteins of unknown function.

6. **Additional data needs:** It's crucial to have metadata that includes information on culture conditions and any previous treatments of the parasite lines to control for potential confounding factors in our analyses. This can improve the accuracy of our differential expression models.

By leveraging advanced computational techniques alongside traditional methods, we can deepen our understanding of the genetic basis of metronidazole resistance in *Giardia intestinalis*. I'm interested to see how these approaches integrate with the perspectives of other team members.

   - I fully support the idea of using feedback from experimental assays to refine computational models. This can be facilitated by developing a robust data integration framework that allows experimental results to update and calibrate our models dynamically.
   - Using machine learning models that support continual learning could be beneficial. These models can adapt as new data from experimental results becomes available, improving prediction accuracy over time.

2. **Advanced Computational Tools:**
   - Incorporating tools like gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) and network analysis software such as Cytoscape can complement our existing pipeline. These tools help in visualizing and interpreting complex interactions and pathways, especially when integrating experimental data.
   - We should consider biosimulation approaches that model biological processes in silico, providing a virtual testing ground for hypotheses before committing to full-scale wet lab experiments.

3. **Collaborative Data Interpretation:**
   - Regular interdisciplinary discussions will be essential to evaluate model outputs and their biological implications. These sessions can help in translating computational discoveries into actionable biological insights.
   - Engaging with external experts, as suggested, can bring fresh perspectives and should be pursued to ensure we are not working in silos.

By aligning computational models closely with biological validation, we can enhance the robustness and applicability of our findings on metronidazole resistance in *Giardia intestinalis*. I look forward to collaborating on these developments with the team.

Software Developer, please provide your thoughts on the discussion (round 3 of 3). If you do not have anything new or relevant to add, you may say "pass". Remember that you can and should (politely) disagree with other team members if you have a different perspective.

## Software Developer

Thank you, Computational Biologist, for highlighting the integration of computational tools with biological validation. Here are my thoughts on how we can further enhance our pipeline from a software development perspective:

1. **User Interface Features for Data Exploration:**
   - To facilitate data exploration, our user interfaces should include dynamic visualization capabilities. Tools like R Shiny or Python Dash can be used to create dashboards that allow users to interact with data, apply filters, and visualize results through plots and charts.
   - Implementing features for easy comparison of gene expression profiles across different conditions and strains will be crucial. This could include interactive heatmaps or differential expression plots that users can customize.

2. **Modular and Scalable Pipeline Design:**
   - As we integrate new computational tools and techniques, ensuring that our pipeline remains modular will be vital. This will allow us to plug in new modules or switch out components with minimal disruption to the overall workflow.
   - We should leverage containerization using Docker to ensure that our pipeline is both scalable and portable across different computational environments. This will also help manage dependencies and maintain reproducibility.

3. **Feedback Integration and Continuous Improvement:**
   - Building a feedback loop into the pipeline, where experimental results can be incorporated to refine computational models, will be important. This could involve setting up a version-controlled repository for model parameters that can be updated as new data is collected.
   - Regular updates and community-driven improvements should be encouraged, allowing the pipeline to evolve with ongoing research and technological advancements.

4. **Ensuring Accessibility and Usability:**
   - To make sure our pipeline is accessible to all team members, comprehensive user guides and documentation should be developed. These should cover every aspect of the pipeline, from setup to data interpretation.
   - Providing training sessions or workshops might also be beneficial, especially as new features or tools are integrated into the workflow.

By focusing on these aspects, we can ensure that our pipeline is not only robust and reliable but also user-friendly and adaptable to future needs. I'm excited about the potential for this project and look forward to working closely with everyone to bring these ideas to fruition.

Principal Investigator, please summarize the meeting in detail for future discussions, provide a specific recommendation regarding the agenda, and answer the agenda questions (if any) based on the discussion while strictly adhering to the agenda rules (if any).

As a reminder, here is the agenda for the meeting:




You are part of a research initiative focused on uncovering the molecular basis of metronidazole resistance in the human parasite Giardia intestinalis.

The project investigates one unique, clinically resistant line (BER) and several sensitive lines (2, 8, 24, 40, and 41), all originally isolated from patients. 
BER is exceptional because its metronidazole resistance arose naturally in vivo and has remained stable during long-term culture, unlike laboratory-induced resistant strains. 
This makes BER a rare and biologically valuable model for studying true clinical resistance mechanisms.

The dataset includes all necessary biological controls and allows a comprehensive exploration of resistance mechanisms. 
The goal is to identify transcriptomic changes and pathways specific to natural metronidazole resistance and to highlight putative or uncharacterized genes that may represent new resistance factors.

Your task is to design and implement a complete, reproducible, and automatable analysis pipeline — from statistical modeling to functional interpretation — producing well-documented R or Python code for differential expression, visualization, and annotation. 
You may also apply modern computational tools (e.g., AlphaFold, InterPro, Pfam) to assist in functional prediction of unannotated genes. 
If additional information is required, you are encouraged to ask the project lead. Collaboration and clear reasoning are preferred.



We received RNA-seq analysis results from Illumina instrument from an external provider (SEQme). Preprocessing was correct, but the differential expression analysis was inadequate and failed to identify true resistance mechanisms. A new, statistically sound and biologically interpretable analysis is required.

Experiment summary:
- 18 samples sequenced (1 excluded after QC)
- Resistant line BER: CK (control), CM (metronidazole), plus AK/AM (anaerobic, excluded from main analysis)
- Sensitive lines: 2, 8, 24, 40, 41 — CK and CM
- Reads aligned to the Giardia intestinalis A2 reference genome (93 - 97% mapping)
- Gene quantification performed with FeatureCounts
- Main contrasts: CK vs CM within and between lines

Data location:
All input data are in the experimental_data/ folder (count matrices, metadata, genome annotation, and QC reports). 
Incorrect SEQme analyses are included for reference only (DO NOT USE). 
Raw FASTQ/BAM files are stored externally.

Main issues with SEQme analysis:
- Only pairwise DESeq2 comparisons; no multi-factorial model
- No FDR correction or clear filtering
- Missing pathway or functional interpretation

Required re-analysis:
Re-analyze RNA-seq data using an integrative, multi-layer pipeline combining statistical rigor and biological interpretation.

1. Differential expression
- Multi-factorial model: phenotype (resistant vs sensitive), treatment (control vs metronidazole), and interaction
- Identify constitutive resistance (BER vs sensitive baseline)
- Separate drug-induced vs resistance-specific effects
- Control for variability among sensitive strains
- Apply FDR-adjusted thresholds and meaningful log2FC cutoffs

2. Functional analysis
- Perform enrichment and pathway analysis (GO, KEGG, Reactome)
- Rank candidate resistance genes for validation
- Annotate putative or uncharacterized genes linked to resistance

3. Integrative and exploratory analysis
- Use co-expression or network clustering to find gene modules
- Apply AI-assisted prediction for unknown gene functions (e.g., sequence, domain, or structure-based)

Deliverables:
Provide reproducible R/Python code, publication-quality visualizations (volcano plots, PCA, heatmaps, network maps), and propose new hypotheses explaining metronidazole resistance in Giardia intestinalis.
 
Design a transcriptomic analysis plan to identify genes specifically linked to metronidazole resistance in the BER line of Giardia intestinalis. Clearly distinguish resistance-specific effects from general drug responses and baseline strain differences. Propose a statistical model (e.g. with interaction terms) to detect these effects. Prioritize candidate resistance genes for validation and link them to biological functions using functional annotation tools. Include an approach for analyzing uncharacterized (putative) proteins.

As a reminder, here are the agenda questions that must be answered:

1. What is the most effective approach to identify genes linked to metronidazole resistance in *Giardia intestinalis*?

2. How can resistance-specific expression be separated from general drug response and baseline differences between strains?

3. Is a simple comparison sufficient, or is a complex statistical model needed? Why?

4. How should candidate genes be functionally annotated and connected to biological pathways?

5. What strategy can identify and characterize putative (unannotated) proteins among the candidate genes?

6. Are any additional files, metadata, or annotations needed to perform the analysis effectively?

Your summary should take the following form.
