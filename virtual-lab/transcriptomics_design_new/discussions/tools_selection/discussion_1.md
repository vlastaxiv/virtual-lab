### Further Enhanced Agenda Response

Our research initiative aims to uncover the molecular mechanisms underlying metronidazole resistance in *Giardia intestinalis*, focusing on the clinically resistant BER line. The objective is to design a comprehensive, reproducible analysis pipeline using multi-factorial models, functional annotation, and modern computational tools to identify and validate resistance-specific genes. This will involve separating resistance-specific expression from general drug responses and baseline differences, annotating candidate genes, and proposing a strategy for characterizing unannotated proteins.

### Enhanced Integrated Answer

1. **What is the most effective approach to identify genes linked to metronidazole resistance in *Giardia intestinalis*?**

   **Answer:** Implement a multi-factorial statistical model using DESeq2, incorporating phenotype (resistant vs. sensitive), treatment (control vs. metronidazole), and interaction terms. Specifically, include contrasts such as BER control vs. sensitive control and BER metronidazole vs. sensitive metronidazole to capture resistance-specific effects. Validate results using k-fold cross-validation to ensure robustness and reliability.

   **Justification:** By explicitly defining contrasts, we can better isolate resistance-specific effects, as highlighted in summaries 1 and 2. Cross-validation will involve partitioning the data into k subsets, using k-1 subsets for training and one for testing, iteratively, to ensure the model's generalizability.

2. **How can resistance-specific expression be separated from general drug response and baseline differences between strains?**

   **Answer:** Use interaction terms in the statistical model to distinguish between resistance-specific and general drug-induced effects. Apply surrogate variable analysis (SVA) to control for variability among sensitive strains, particularly focusing on batch effects and other confounding variables. Evaluate the effectiveness of SVA by quantifying the reduction in variance attributed to unwanted factors using metrics such as the proportion of variance explained.

   **Justification:** Interaction terms and SVA, as emphasized in summaries 1 and 2, provide a nuanced view of how different factors contribute to gene expression changes, ensuring precise identification of key genes. Metrics such as variance explained by surrogate variables will be used to assess SVA effectiveness.

3. **Is a simple comparison sufficient, or is a complex statistical model needed? Why?**

   **Answer:** A complex statistical model is needed.

   **Justification:** The dataset's complexity, including multiple phenotypes and treatments, necessitates a sophisticated model to capture subtle expression changes and interactions, as noted in all summaries. For example, the interaction between treatment and phenotype could reveal unique resistance mechanisms not apparent in simple comparisons, such as differential expression patterns specific to the BER line under metronidazole treatment.

4. **How should candidate genes be functionally annotated and connected to biological pathways?**

   **Answer:** Utilize tools like InterPro, Pfam, KEGG, and GO for enrichment analysis, integrated into the pipeline. The workflow will start with differential expression analysis, followed by pathway mapping using these tools, and finally, visualization of results to identify novel pathways potentially involved in resistance. Scripts in R or Python will automate these steps, ensuring seamless integration.

   **Justification:** These tools, recommended in summaries 3 and 5, provide comprehensive insights into gene functions and their roles in biological pathways, enhancing the functional context of candidate genes. The integration will be automated to ensure efficiency and consistency.

5. **What strategy can identify and characterize putative (unannotated) proteins among the candidate genes?**

   **Answer:** Apply AI-assisted tools like AlphaFold for structural predictions and network analysis for functional predictions. Develop a scoring system based on expression, connectivity, and evolutionary conservation to prioritize proteins for further study. The scoring system will be validated by comparing predicted functions with known protein functions in related species, using a weighted approach where criteria are selected based on their relevance to resistance mechanisms.

   **Justification:** These methods, suggested in summaries 2 and 5, provide structural and functional context, essential for hypothesizing roles of unannotated proteins and prioritizing them for further study. The scoring system will be developed using a weighted approach, with criteria selected based on their relevance to resistance mechanisms.

6. **Are any additional files, metadata, or annotations needed to perform the analysis effectively?**

   **Answer:** Ensure comprehensive metadata on experimental conditions, phenotypic resistance data, and access to relevant pathway databases like EuPathDB. Metadata management will be facilitated using software such as REDCap or similar tools to ensure consistency and ease of updates.

   **Justification:** As noted in summaries 3 and 5, complete and accurate metadata is crucial for robust statistical modeling and contextual interpretation of results. A standardized metadata template will be used to maintain consistency across samples.

### Next Steps

1. **Develop the Analysis Pipeline:** Begin implementation of the modular and scalable pipeline using Snakemake or Nextflow, integrating statistical, machine learning, and functional annotation tools. Clearly define each step and its purpose in the pipeline documentation.

2. **Enhance User Interfaces:** Design and implement user-friendly dashboards for data exploration using R Shiny or Python Dash, ensuring accessibility for all team members.

3. **Engage in Experimental Validation:** Collaborate with parasitology experts to plan and conduct validation experiments, incorporating their results into the pipeline to refine computational models.

4. **Regular Checkpoints:** Establish regular team meetings to review progress, share insights, and iteratively refine the analysis based on feedback and new data.

5. **Training Workshops:** Conduct sessions to familiarize the team with new tools and methods, ensuring all members are equipped to contribute effectively to the analysis.

By addressing the feedback, this revised response provides a more detailed, actionable, and aligned plan with the project's objectives, ensuring a thorough, reproducible, and biologically meaningful analysis.

Here is the agenda for the meeting:



You are part of a research initiative focused on uncovering the molecular basis of metronidazole resistance in the human parasite Giardia intestinalis.

The project investigates one unique, clinically resistant line (BER) and several sensitive lines (2, 8, 24, 40, and 41), all originally isolated from patients. 
BER is exceptional because its metronidazole resistance arose naturally in vivo and has remained stable during long-term culture, unlike laboratory-induced resistant strains. 
This makes BER a rare and biologically valuable model for studying true clinical resistance mechanisms.

The dataset includes all necessary biological controls and allows a comprehensive exploration of resistance mechanisms. 
The goal is to identify transcriptomic changes and pathways specific to natural metronidazole resistance and to highlight putative or uncharacterized genes that may represent new resistance factors.

Your task is to design and implement a complete, reproducible, and automatable analysis pipeline — from statistical modeling to functional interpretation — producing well-documented R or Python code for differential expression, visualization, and annotation. 
You may also apply modern computational tools (e.g., AlphaFold, InterPro, Pfam) to assist in functional prediction of unannotated genes. 
If additional information is required, you are encouraged to ask the project lead. Collaboration and clear reasoning are preferred.



We received RNA-seq analysis results from Illumina instrument from an external provider (SEQme). Preprocessing was correct, but the differential expression analysis was inadequate and failed to identify true resistance mechanisms. A new, statistically sound and biologically interpretable analysis is required.

Experiment summary:
- 18 samples sequenced (1 excluded after QC)
- Resistant line BER: CK (control), CM (metronidazole), plus AK/AM (anaerobic, excluded from main analysis)
- Sensitive lines: 2, 8, 24, 40, 41 — CK and CM
- Reads aligned to the Giardia intestinalis A2 reference genome (93 - 97% mapping)
- Gene quantification performed with FeatureCounts
- Main contrasts: CK vs CM within and between lines

Data location:
All input data are in the experimental_data/ folder (count matrices, metadata, genome annotation, and QC reports). 
Incorrect SEQme analyses are included for reference only (DO NOT USE). 
Raw FASTQ/BAM files are stored externally.

Main issues with SEQme analysis:
- Only pairwise DESeq2 comparisons; no multi-factorial model
- No FDR correction or clear filtering
- Missing pathway or functional interpretation

Required re-analysis:
Re-analyze RNA-seq data using an integrative, multi-layer pipeline combining statistical rigor and biological interpretation.

1. Differential expression
- Multi-factorial model: phenotype (resistant vs sensitive), treatment (control vs metronidazole), and interaction
- Identify constitutive resistance (BER vs sensitive baseline)
- Separate drug-induced vs resistance-specific effects
- Control for variability among sensitive strains
- Apply FDR-adjusted thresholds and meaningful log2FC cutoffs

2. Functional analysis
- Perform enrichment and pathway analysis (GO, KEGG, Reactome)
- Rank candidate resistance genes for validation
- Annotate putative or uncharacterized genes linked to resistance

3. Integrative and exploratory analysis
- Use co-expression or network clustering to find gene modules
- Apply AI-assisted prediction for unknown gene functions (e.g., sequence, domain, or structure-based)

Deliverables:
Provide reproducible R/Python code, publication-quality visualizations (volcano plots, PCA, heatmaps, network maps), and propose new hypotheses explaining metronidazole resistance in Giardia intestinalis.


Based on the finalized project specification, identify the specific computational and bioinformatics tools required to implement the transcriptomics analysis plan in practice.

Focus on selecting and justifying concrete tools, libraries, or platforms that will make the workflow executable and reproducible — from differential expression to functional annotation and visualization.

Your selection should:
- Build directly on the statistical and analytical strategy defined in the project specification.
- Include both established tools and recent innovations relevant to the field.
- Consider compatibility between R and Python environments (e.g., DESeq2 + Scikit-learn integration).
- Highlight new or improved AI-based platforms for protein structure and function prediction.
- Reflect the specific challenges of non-model organisms like Giardia intestinalis.

For each tool, please specify:
1. How it will be used in the workflow and at which step.
2. Why it is appropriate for this project and what makes it preferable to alternatives.
3. Any recent or experimental tools worth exploring as complementary options.
4. How the tool will interface with others in the pipeline to ensure automation and reproducibility.


Here are the agenda questions that must be answered:

1. Which computational tools and libraries should be used for each stage of the RNA-seq analysis (differential expression, annotation, visualization)?

2. How will each selected tool be applied specifically to identify metronidazole resistance mechanisms?

3. Which pathway databases and annotation resources are most appropriate for Giardia intestinalis?

4. Which modern or AI-driven tools can improve the prediction and characterization of putative proteins?

5. Are there any recent tools or databases developed for protozoan genomics that could enhance this analysis?

Principal Investigator will convene the meeting. Then, each team member will provide their thoughts on the discussion one-by-one in the order above. After all team members have given their input, Principal Investigator will synthesize the points raised by each team member, make decisions regarding the agenda based on team member input, and ask follow-up questions to gather more information and feedback about how to better address the agenda. This will continue for 3 rounds. Once the discussion is complete, Principal Investigator will summarize the meeting in detail for future discussions, provide a specific recommendation regarding the agenda, and answer the agenda questions (if any) based on the discussion while strictly adhering to the agenda rules (if any).

Thank you, Principal Investigator. I appreciate the opportunity to share my thoughts on the tools and strategies for our RNA-seq analysis pipeline.

1. **Differential Expression Tools:**
   - I strongly recommend using DESeq2 for our differential expression analysis, as it is well-suited to handle the complex multi-factorial models we require. DESeq2 allows us to incorporate phenotype, treatment, and interaction terms, which are crucial for distinguishing resistance-specific effects. Additionally, I propose integrating edgeR for comparative purposes, providing a cross-validation layer to ensure robustness. This dual approach can help us confirm the results from DESeq2, especially considering the intricacies of our resistance model.

2. **Functional Annotation and Visualization:**
   - For functional annotation, we should leverage tools like InterPro and Pfam for protein domain analysis. GO and KEGG will be essential for pathway enrichment analysis, with Reactome as a complementary resource. These tools provide comprehensive coverage for a broad range of biological pathways and functions. For visualization, I suggest using ggplot2 in R for its flexibility and aesthetics in creating publication-quality plots. Additionally, Cytoscape can be used for network visualization to showcase gene interactions and pathways.

3. **AI-driven Tools for Protein Prediction:**
   - AlphaFold is a leading choice for predicting protein structures, and I recommend its use for the characterization of unannotated proteins. We should also consider using tools like DeepMind's ESM (Evolutionary Scale Modeling) for functional predictions based on evolutionary data. These AI-driven tools can provide insights into protein functions that are not apparent from sequence data alone.

4. **Protozoan-specific Resources:**
   - Given our focus on *Giardia*, I suggest we explore resources like EuPathDB, which is specifically tailored for eukaryotic pathogens, including protozoa. This database offers a wealth of genomic and functional data that can be integral to our analysis. Another tool worth exploring is OrthoDB, which might give us comparative insights across related species.

Overall, the integration of these tools will create a robust and reproducible workflow that can effectively tackle the challenges presented by our research objectives. I look forward to hearing the perspectives of the other team members and refining our strategy based on collective expertise.

## Parasitology Expert

Thank you for the opportunity to contribute. Here are my thoughts on integrating the biological context into our computational framework:

1. **Differential Expression Tools:**
   - I fully support the use of DESeq2 for differential expression analysis, particularly for its ability to model complex interactions. It's crucial that we ensure our choice of contrasts within the model reflects biologically meaningful comparisons, such as BER control vs. sensitive control, to isolate resistance-specific expression changes. Additionally, we should explore integrating transcriptome assembly tools like Trinity for any novel transcripts that might not be captured by reference-based approaches, which can be particularly relevant for non-model organisms like *Giardia*.

2. **Functional Annotation and Visualization:**
   - While InterPro and Pfam are excellent choices for domain analysis, I suggest placing additional emphasis on Enzyme Commission (EC) numbers and metabolic pathway databases that are relevant to *Giardia*'s unique metabolism. Giardia's anaerobic energy metabolism could be a key area where resistance mechanisms manifest, so databases that can provide insights into these pathways, such as MetaCyc, could be invaluable.

3. **AI-driven Tools for Protein Prediction:**
   - AlphaFold is well-suited for predicting protein structures, but I would like us to consider the biological plausibility of these predictions, particularly in the context of *Giardia's* unique physiology. It's important that we pair these predictions with experimental data where possible. Exploring tools like Rosetta, which offers comprehensive protein tertiary and quaternary structure predictions, might add additional layers of validation to our structural predictions.

4. **Protozoan-specific Resources:**
   - EuPathDB is indeed a rich resource for protozoan genomics. Additionally, databases like GiardiaDB offer specialized data that could enhance our functional annotation efforts specific to *Giardia*. These resources, combined with domain-specific databases, can offer a more comprehensive biological context for our findings.

Overall, it's crucial that our bioinformatics tools are not only robust but also capable of providing insights that are biologically grounded in the peculiarities of *Giardia*'s physiology and metabolism. This will enhance our ability to identify novel resistance mechanisms and potential targets for therapeutic intervention. I look forward to integrating our computational insights with biological interpretation to achieve a holistic understanding of metronidazole resistance.

## Parasitology Expert

Thank you for the opportunity to expand on how we can validate protein function predictions from AI-driven tools like AlphaFold and GREMLIN.

**Validation of Protein Function Predictions:**

1. **Experimental Validation:**
   - **Biochemical Assays:** For proteins predicted to have enzymatic functions, conducting biochemical assays to test for activity can validate functional predictions. This is particularly relevant for enzymes involved in metabolic pathways, which could be implicated in resistance mechanisms.
   - **Protein Localization Studies:** Using techniques like immunofluorescence or GFP-tagging, we can determine the cellular localization of predicted proteins. Localization data can provide clues about protein function and its role in metronidazole resistance, especially if proteins localize to mitochondrion-like organelles in *Giardia*, which are known to be involved in drug metabolism.
   - **Protein-Protein Interaction Studies:** Co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) or yeast two-hybrid assays can validate predicted protein interactions suggested by GREMLIN. These studies can help us understand how proteins function within resistance-related pathways.

2. **Integration with Transcriptomic Data:**
   - **Correlate Expression and Function:** We should correlate the expression levels of candidate genes with their predicted functions to identify those that are not only differentially expressed but also potentially involved in resistance pathways.
   - **Cross-reference with Known Pathways:** Validation should involve cross-referencing predicted protein functions with known pathways of metronidazole action or resistance in *Giardia* or related organisms.

3. **Experimental Design Considerations:**
   - **Selecting Candidates for Validation:** Prioritize candidates based on the strength of prediction scores, conservation across related species, and differential expression patterns. A scoring system integrating these factors can streamline candidate selection.
   - **Resource Allocation:** Given resource constraints, focus experimental efforts on validating key proteins that are most likely to impact resistance mechanisms, based on both computational predictions and transcriptomic data.

By combining computational predictions with targeted experimental validation, we can strengthen our conclusions about the roles of specific proteins in metronidazole resistance. I look forward to further discussing how these strategies fit into our overall pipeline and hearing thoughts on computational model enhancements.

## Computational Biologist

Thank you, Principal Investigator. I would like to address how we can effectively incorporate machine learning into our differential expression analysis to enhance our understanding of metronidazole resistance mechanisms.

**Incorporating Machine Learning:**

1. **Predictive Modeling:**
   - **Use of Scikit-learn:** We can use Scikit-learn to develop classifiers that predict resistance based on gene expression profiles. Random forests or support vector machines (SVM) could be particularly effective for this task due to their ability to handle complex, non-linear relationships in data. These models can prioritize genes that are most predictive of the resistant phenotype.
   - **Feature Selection:** Implement techniques such as recursive feature elimination (RFE) or LASSO (Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator) to identify the most informative genes. This can aid in refining our list of candidate genes for further validation and study.

2. **Integration with Statistical Models:**
   - **Combining Models:** We can complement our DESeq2 and edgeR results with machine learning insights to confirm key findings. By integrating machine learning predictions with statistical output, we can develop a more nuanced understanding of gene expression changes linked to resistance.
   - **Validation and Cross-validation:** Employ techniques like k-fold cross-validation to assess the robustness and generalizability of our models. This will ensure that our predictions are reliable and not artifacts of the specific dataset.

3. **Outcome Expectations:**
   - **Enhanced Interpretation:** Machine learning models can help us identify patterns and interactions that may not be evident through traditional statistical methods alone, offering new biological insights.
   - **Prioritization of Targets:** By identifying the most predictive genes and pathways, we can better prioritize targets for experimental validation, thus optimizing resource allocation.

Overall, integrating machine learning into our pipeline will provide complementary insights and add an additional layer of confidence to our findings. It will also assist in generating hypothesized models of resistance that can guide future experimental designs. I am eager to discuss how we can technically implement these ideas and synchronize them with our overall computational strategy.

Thank you, Principal Investigator. I'd like to address the technical considerations regarding the containerization of our pipeline using Docker and discuss its role in enhancing collaboration and reproducibility.

**Containerization with Docker:**

1. **Steps to Containerize the Pipeline:**
   - **Dockerfile Creation:** Develop a Dockerfile specifying the base image (e.g., a specific version of R or Python) and all necessary dependencies, including libraries like DESeq2, Scikit-learn, AlphaFold, etc. This ensures that anyone running the container has the exact same environment setup.
   - **Build and Test:** Build the Docker image and test it locally to ensure all components of the pipeline function as expected within the container.
   - **Version Control:** Use version tags to manage different iterations of the Docker image as the pipeline evolves. This allows us to roll back to previous versions if necessary.

2. **Facilitating Collaboration:**
   - **Consistency Across Environments:** Docker ensures that everyone on the team, regardless of their local setup, can run the pipeline under identical conditions. This eliminates "it works on my machine" issues and aids in debugging.
   - **Easy Sharing and Deployment:** Docker images can be shared via Docker Hub or private repositories, making it easier for team members to access and deploy the pipeline quickly. This is particularly useful for collaboration with external partners or across different institutional infrastructures.

3. **Enhancing Reproducibility:**
   - **Reproducible Analysis:** By capturing the entire computational environment in a Docker container, we ensure that analyses can be replicated in the future, promoting reproducibility in our research findings.
   - **Automated Workflow Integration:** Combine Docker with workflow management tools like Snakemake or Nextflow to automate the execution of the pipeline. This includes setting up automatic triggers for running the pipeline whenever new data is added or when changes are made to the codebase.

In summary, Docker provides a robust framework for managing dependencies and ensuring that our pipeline runs consistently across different systems, which is crucial for maintaining reproducibility and facilitating collaboration. If there are any specific challenges anticipated in terms of compatibility or deployment, I am eager to address those in the next round of discussion.

## User

Bioinformatics Specialist, please provide your thoughts on the discussion (round 3 of 3). If you do not have anything new or relevant to add, you may say "pass". Remember that you can and should (politely) disagree with other team members if you have a different perspective.

## Bioinformatics Specialist

Thank you, Principal Investigator. I'd like to address the follow-up question regarding scenarios where edgeR might outperform DESeq2.

**Scenarios Favoring edgeR Over DESeq2:**

1. **Small Sample Sizes:**
   - edgeR is particularly adept at handling datasets with small sample sizes. Its robust empirical Bayes methods for dispersion estimation can sometimes outperform DESeq2 under these conditions, providing more reliable differential expression results when data is limited.

2. **Complex Experimental Designs:**
   - While DESeq2 is very powerful, edgeR offers additional flexibility in creating more complex contrast matrices that might be beneficial in scenarios where we have complex interactions or nested designs. This can be useful if we need to explore more specific or nuanced interactions beyond our current model scope.

3. **Specific Distributional Assumptions:**
   - If the underlying assumptions about variance and distribution of counts align more closely with those used by edgeR, it might produce more accurate estimates. Although both tools use similar underlying models, edgeR’s ability to handle overdispersion in certain datasets can occasionally make it preferable.

**Conclusion:**
We should leverage both DESeq2 and edgeR to cross-validate results, particularly focusing on cases where edgeR's strengths are most applicable. This dual approach will ensure our findings are robust across different statistical perspectives.

I believe this multifaceted strategy will position us well to comprehensively identify differential expression patterns crucial to understanding metronidazole resistance. I’m looking forward to hearing how our parasitology expert envisions integrating experimental validation with our computational insights.

## Computational Biologist

Thank you, Principal Investigator. I'll address the question regarding potential challenges in integrating machine learning predictions with traditional statistical outputs and suggest strategies to manage them.

**Challenges and Strategies for Integration:**

1. **Data Compatibility:**
   - **Challenge:** Ensuring that the feature sets used in machine learning models align with those identified as significant in traditional statistical analyses. Discrepancies can arise due to different assumptions and methods of feature selection.
   - **Strategy:** Implement preprocessing pipelines that standardize data inputs for both methods. Use dimensionality reduction techniques, like PCA, to simplify complex datasets while maintaining alignment with statistically significant features identified by DESeq2 or edgeR.

2. **Interpretability:**
   - **Challenge:** Machine learning models, especially more complex ones like random forests or neural networks, can be less interpretable compared to traditional statistics, which can hinder biological interpretation.
   - **Strategy:** Focus on model interpretability by using techniques like SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) values to understand the contribution of individual features. Pair these insights with statistically significant outputs to draw comprehensive conclusions.

3. **Model Validation:**
   - **Challenge:** Balancing the need for robust model validation with computational demands, especially when combining multiple predictive approaches.
   - **Strategy:** Utilize cross-validation techniques consistently across both statistical and machine learning models. This ensures that performance metrics are comparable and that models are reliably evaluated against the same validation datasets.

4. **Integration of Results:**
   - **Challenge:** Synthesizing results from machine learning and statistical models into a cohesive narrative that informs biological understanding.
   - **Strategy:** Develop a scoring system that integrates confidence scores from statistical analyses with predictive scores from machine learning. This can streamline the identification of high-priority genes for further study.

By addressing these challenges, we can effectively integrate machine learning with traditional statistics, enhancing our predictive capacity and ensuring that our analysis remains biologically informative. I look forward to hearing how the software developer plans to facilitate this integration through technical solutions like Docker and workflow automation.

## User

Principal Investigator, please summarize the meeting in detail for future discussions, provide a specific recommendation regarding the agenda, and answer the agenda questions (if any) based on the discussion while strictly adhering to the agenda rules (if any).

As a reminder, here is the agenda for the meeting:



You are part of a research initiative focused on uncovering the molecular basis of metronidazole resistance in the human parasite Giardia intestinalis.

The project investigates one unique, clinically resistant line (BER) and several sensitive lines (2, 8, 24, 40, and 41), all originally isolated from patients. 
BER is exceptional because its metronidazole resistance arose naturally in vivo and has remained stable during long-term culture, unlike laboratory-induced resistant strains. 
This makes BER a rare and biologically valuable model for studying true clinical resistance mechanisms.

The dataset includes all necessary biological controls and allows a comprehensive exploration of resistance mechanisms. 
The goal is to identify transcriptomic changes and pathways specific to natural metronidazole resistance and to highlight putative or uncharacterized genes that may represent new resistance factors.

Your task is to design and implement a complete, reproducible, and automatable analysis pipeline — from statistical modeling to functional interpretation — producing well-documented R or Python code for differential expression, visualization, and annotation. 
You may also apply modern computational tools (e.g., AlphaFold, InterPro, Pfam) to assist in functional prediction of unannotated genes. 
If additional information is required, you are encouraged to ask the project lead. Collaboration and clear reasoning are preferred.



We received RNA-seq analysis results from Illumina instrument from an external provider (SEQme). Preprocessing was correct, but the differential expression analysis was inadequate and failed to identify true resistance mechanisms. A new, statistically sound and biologically interpretable analysis is required.

Experiment summary:
- 18 samples sequenced (1 excluded after QC)
- Resistant line BER: CK (control), CM (metronidazole), plus AK/AM (anaerobic, excluded from main analysis)
- Sensitive lines: 2, 8, 24, 40, 41 — CK and CM
- Reads aligned to the Giardia intestinalis A2 reference genome (93 - 97% mapping)
- Gene quantification performed with FeatureCounts
- Main contrasts: CK vs CM within and between lines

Data location:
All input data are in the experimental_data/ folder (count matrices, metadata, genome annotation, and QC reports). 
Incorrect SEQme analyses are included for reference only (DO NOT USE). 
Raw FASTQ/BAM files are stored externally.

Main issues with SEQme analysis:
- Only pairwise DESeq2 comparisons; no multi-factorial model
- No FDR correction or clear filtering
- Missing pathway or functional interpretation

Required re-analysis:
Re-analyze RNA-seq data using an integrative, multi-layer pipeline combining statistical rigor and biological interpretation.

1. Differential expression
- Multi-factorial model: phenotype (resistant vs sensitive), treatment (control vs metronidazole), and interaction
- Identify constitutive resistance (BER vs sensitive baseline)
- Separate drug-induced vs resistance-specific effects
- Control for variability among sensitive strains
- Apply FDR-adjusted thresholds and meaningful log2FC cutoffs

2. Functional analysis
- Perform enrichment and pathway analysis (GO, KEGG, Reactome)
- Rank candidate resistance genes for validation
- Annotate putative or uncharacterized genes linked to resistance

3. Integrative and exploratory analysis
- Use co-expression or network clustering to find gene modules
- Apply AI-assisted prediction for unknown gene functions (e.g., sequence, domain, or structure-based)

Deliverables:
Provide reproducible R/Python code, publication-quality visualizations (volcano plots, PCA, heatmaps, network maps), and propose new hypotheses explaining metronidazole resistance in Giardia intestinalis.


Based on the finalized project specification, identify the specific computational and bioinformatics tools required to implement the transcriptomics analysis plan in practice.

Focus on selecting and justifying concrete tools, libraries, or platforms that will make the workflow executable and reproducible — from differential expression to functional annotation and visualization.

Your selection should:
- Build directly on the statistical and analytical strategy defined in the project specification.
- Include both established tools and recent innovations relevant to the field.
- Consider compatibility between R and Python environments (e.g., DESeq2 + Scikit-learn integration).
- Highlight new or improved AI-based platforms for protein structure and function prediction.
- Reflect the specific challenges of non-model organisms like Giardia intestinalis.

For each tool, please specify:
1. How it will be used in the workflow and at which step.
2. Why it is appropriate for this project and what makes it preferable to alternatives.
3. Any recent or experimental tools worth exploring as complementary options.
4. How the tool will interface with others in the pipeline to ensure automation and reproducibility.


As a reminder, here are the agenda questions that must be answered:

1. Which computational tools and libraries should be used for each stage of the RNA-seq analysis (differential expression, annotation, visualization)?

2. How will each selected tool be applied specifically to identify metronidazole resistance mechanisms?

3. Which pathway databases and annotation resources are most appropriate for Giardia intestinalis?

4. Which modern or AI-driven tools can improve the prediction and characterization of putative proteins?

5. Are there any recent tools or databases developed for protozoan genomics that could enhance this analysis?

Your summary should take the following form.
