## User

This is the beginning of a team meeting to discuss your research project. This is a meeting with the team lead, Principal Investigator, and the following team members: Bioinformatics Specialist, Parasitology Expert, Computational Biologist, Software Developer.

Here is the agenda for the meeting:




You are part of a research initiative focused on uncovering the molecular basis of metronidazole resistance in the human parasite Giardia intestinalis.

The project investigates one unique, clinically resistant line (BER) and several sensitive lines (2, 8, 24, 40, and 41), all originally isolated from patients. 
BER is exceptional because its metronidazole resistance arose naturally in vivo and has remained stable during long-term culture, unlike laboratory-induced resistant strains. 
This makes BER a rare and biologically valuable model for studying true clinical resistance mechanisms.

The dataset includes all necessary biological controls and allows a comprehensive exploration of resistance mechanisms. 
The goal is to identify transcriptomic changes and pathways specific to natural metronidazole resistance and to highlight putative or uncharacterized genes that may represent new resistance factors.

Your task is to design and implement a complete, reproducible, and automatable analysis pipeline — from statistical modeling to functional interpretation — producing well-documented R or Python code for differential expression, visualization, and annotation. 
You may also apply modern computational tools (e.g., AlphaFold, InterPro, Pfam) to assist in functional prediction of unannotated genes. 
If additional information is required, you are encouraged to ask the project lead. Collaboration and clear reasoning are preferred.



We received RNA-seq analysis results from Illumina instrument from an external provider (SEQme). Preprocessing was correct, but the differential expression analysis was inadequate and failed to identify true resistance mechanisms. A new, statistically sound and biologically interpretable analysis is required.

Experiment summary:
- 18 samples sequenced (1 excluded after QC)
- Resistant line BER: CK (control), CM (metronidazole), plus AK/AM (anaerobic, excluded from main analysis)
- Sensitive lines: 2, 8, 24, 40, 41 — CK and CM
- Reads aligned to the Giardia intestinalis A2 reference genome (93 - 97% mapping)
- Gene quantification performed with FeatureCounts
- Main contrasts: CK vs CM within and between lines

Data location:
All input data are in the experimental_data/ folder (count matrices, metadata, genome annotation, and QC reports). 
Incorrect SEQme analyses are included for reference only (DO NOT USE). 
Raw FASTQ/BAM files are stored externally.

Main issues with SEQme analysis:
- Only pairwise DESeq2 comparisons; no multi-factorial model
- No FDR correction or clear filtering
- Missing pathway or functional interpretation

Required re-analysis:
Re-analyze RNA-seq data using an integrative, multi-layer pipeline combining statistical rigor and biological interpretation.

1. Differential expression
- Multi-factorial model: phenotype (resistant vs sensitive), treatment (control vs metronidazole), and interaction
- Identify constitutive resistance (BER vs sensitive baseline)
- Separate drug-induced vs resistance-specific effects
- Control for variability among sensitive strains
- Apply FDR-adjusted thresholds and meaningful log2FC cutoffs

2. Functional analysis
- Perform enrichment and pathway analysis (GO, KEGG, Reactome)
- Rank candidate resistance genes for validation
- Annotate putative or uncharacterized genes linked to resistance

3. Integrative and exploratory analysis
- Use co-expression or network clustering to find gene modules
- Apply AI-assisted prediction for unknown gene functions (e.g., sequence, domain, or structure-based)

Deliverables:
Provide reproducible R/Python code, publication-quality visualizations (volcano plots, PCA, heatmaps, network maps), and propose new hypotheses explaining metronidazole resistance in Giardia intestinalis.
 
Design a transcriptomic analysis plan to identify genes specifically linked to metronidazole resistance in the BER line of Giardia intestinalis. Clearly distinguish resistance-specific effects from general drug responses and baseline strain differences. Propose a statistical model (e.g. with interaction terms) to detect these effects. Prioritize candidate resistance genes for validation and link them to biological functions using functional annotation tools. Include an approach for analyzing uncharacterized (putative) proteins.

Here are the agenda questions that must be answered:

1. What is the most effective approach to identify genes linked to metronidazole resistance in *Giardia intestinalis*?

2. How can resistance-specific expression be separated from general drug response and baseline differences between strains?

3. Is a simple comparison sufficient, or is a complex statistical model needed? Why?

4. How should candidate genes be functionally annotated and connected to biological pathways?

5. What strategy can identify and characterize putative (unannotated) proteins among the candidate genes?

6. Are any additional files, metadata, or annotations needed to perform the analysis effectively?

Principal Investigator will convene the meeting. Then, each team member will provide their thoughts on the discussion one-by-one in the order above. After all team members have given their input, Principal Investigator will synthesize the points raised by each team member, make decisions regarding the agenda based on team member input, and ask follow-up questions to gather more information and feedback about how to better address the agenda. This will continue for 3 rounds. Once the discussion is complete, Principal Investigator will summarize the meeting in detail for future discussions, provide a specific recommendation regarding the agenda, and answer the agenda questions (if any) based on the discussion while strictly adhering to the agenda rules (if any).

## User

Principal Investigator, please provide your initial thoughts on the agenda as well as any questions you have to guide the discussion among the team members.

## Principal Investigator

Thank you all for joining this meeting. Our primary focus today is to establish a robust analytical framework for identifying the molecular basis of metronidazole resistance in the Giardia intestinalis BER line. As we proceed, I'd like to ensure that our approach is interdisciplinary, leveraging each of your expertise areas.

Here are some key points and questions to guide our discussion:

1. **Differential Expression Analysis**: It's crucial that we use a multi-factorial model to capture the complexity of our data, particularly distinguishing between natural resistance mechanisms and general drug responses. How do you suggest structuring this model to account for any variability among sensitive strains and potential interactions between phenotypes and treatments?

2. **Statistical Modeling**: Given the inadequacies in the previous analysis, a simple comparison may not suffice. What statistical techniques should we employ to ensure robustness and biological interpretability? What interaction terms would be most informative in this context?

3. **Functional Annotation and Pathway Analysis**: We need to systematically annotate candidate genes and link them to relevant biological pathways. What tools and methodologies do you recommend for accurately performing these annotations?

4. **Characterization of Putative Proteins**: Identifying and understanding uncharacterized proteins is pivotal. What strategies can we employ to predict their functions effectively, especially using tools like AlphaFold or domain-based predictions?

5. **Data Completeness and Quality**: Are there any additional files, metadata, or annotations that you believe are necessary to perform a thorough analysis? How can we ensure all our data inputs support a comprehensive analysis?

I appreciate your insights on these points. Let’s begin with the Bioinformatics Specialist, who can provide their thoughts on the most effective approach to identify genes linked to metronidazole resistance. Please consider how we can implement a robust analytical strategy with reproducibility and clarity in mind.

## User

Bioinformatics Specialist, please provide your thoughts on the discussion (round 1 of 3). If you do not have anything new or relevant to add, you may say "pass". Remember that you can and should (politely) disagree with other team members if you have a different perspective.

## Bioinformatics Specialist

Thank you, Principal Investigator. I'd like to outline a comprehensive strategy for our RNA-seq analysis, focusing on the differential expression aspects:

1. **Identifying Genes Linked to Resistance**: To effectively pinpoint genes associated with metronidazole resistance, we should employ a multi-factorial model using DESeq2 or edgeR. This model should incorporate factors such as phenotype (resistant vs. sensitive), treatment (control vs. metronidazole), and their interaction. This approach allows us to discern resistance-specific expression patterns separate from general drug responses or inter-strain variability.

2. **Separating Resistance-Specific Expression**: Including interaction terms in our model will be key. Specifically, a phenotype-by-treatment interaction term can help isolate the expression changes unique to the BER line under metronidazole treatment, distinguishing them from generic drug responses present in sensitive lines.

3. **Complex Statistical Model Necessity**: A complex statistical model is needed due to the multifaceted nature of resistance mechanisms and the inherent variability between strains. A simple pairwise comparison would miss these intricate interactions, potentially leading to incorrect conclusions about which genes are truly involved in resistance.

4. **Functional Annotation and Pathway Analysis**: Once we have our candidate genes, tools like InterPro and KEGG can help annotate these genes and map them to pathways involved in resistance mechanisms. This will guide us in understanding the broader biological context of the resistance.

5. **Characterizing Putative Proteins**: For unannotated genes, leveraging AI-based tools like AlphaFold for structural predictions, along with domain-based predictions from Pfam, would be beneficial. This multi-tool approach will aid in hypothesizing potential functions based on structure and domain presence.

6. **Data Completeness**: I recommend ensuring we have access to comprehensive metadata, including detailed sample conditions and any batch information. This will help us account for potential confounding variables in our analysis.

I look forward to hearing the perspectives of other team members and discussing how we can integrate these approaches.

Parasitology Expert, please provide your thoughts on the discussion (round 1 of 3). If you do not have anything new or relevant to add, you may say "pass". Remember that you can and should (politely) disagree with other team members if you have a different perspective.

## Parasitology Expert

Thank you, and I appreciate the Bioinformatics Specialist's comprehensive approach to the differential expression analysis. From a parasitology standpoint, I would like to emphasize a few key aspects:

1. **Biological Context in Differential Expression**: When identifying genes linked to metronidazole resistance, it's crucial to keep in mind the unique biology of Giardia intestinalis. The resistance mechanisms might involve not just metabolic pathways but also changes in cell structure or stress response pathways. Therefore, when we interpret the DE results, we should consider these biological processes.

2. **Mechanistic Insights into Resistance**: Beyond statistical modeling, examining known resistance pathways in Giardia and other protozoans can guide our interpretation. For instance, nitroreductase activity, oxidative stress responses, and DNA repair mechanisms are known to contribute to metronidazole resistance in Giardia. We should prioritize genes linked to these processes when annotating DE results.

3. **Importance of Interaction Terms**: I agree on the necessity of using complex models with interaction terms, as it allows us to parse out biologically relevant interactions. However, we must also be cautious about overfitting and ensure that any identified interactions have biological plausibility based on what is known about Giardia's biology.

4. **Functional Annotation and Pathway Analysis**: While bioinformatics tools like InterPro and KEGG are invaluable, it's equally important to cross-reference findings with the existing Giardia literature and databases specific to protozoans. This helps provide a more tailored biological interpretation.

5. **Characterization of Putative Proteins**: For putative proteins, understanding their contribution to resistance will involve looking at homology with known protein families and experimental data from related organisms. Functional predictions should be complemented with laboratory validation.

6. **Data Needs**: I would stress the importance of having high-quality annotation data specific to Giardia. Additionally, any existing proteomics data could be instrumental in validating transcriptomic findings.

By integrating these biological insights with our bioinformatics framework, we can enhance the interpretability and relevance of our findings. I'm eager to hear the Computational Biologist's perspective on how we can further leverage computational tools in this analysis.

Computational Biologist, please provide your thoughts on the discussion (round 1 of 3). If you do not have anything new or relevant to add, you may say "pass". Remember that you can and should (politely) disagree with other team members if you have a different perspective.

## Computational Biologist

Thank you. Building on the points made by the Bioinformatics Specialist and Parasitology Expert, I’d like to focus on the computational aspects:

1. **Complex Statistical Modeling**: I concur that a multi-factorial model incorporating interaction terms is essential. We might consider using linear models with interaction terms in DESeq2 or edgeR, coupled with robust FDR correction methods to manage the multiple testing that comes with these models.

2. **Integrative Functional Analysis**: Beyond traditional pathway analysis, employing tools like Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) could help us capture subtle changes in expression patterns that may not be significant at the individual gene level but are important at the pathway level. This could uncover hidden resistance mechanisms.

3. **Co-expression and Network Analysis**: To identify potential modules of co-expressed genes that might share functional roles, we could implement weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA). This can help prioritize genes not only based on differential expression but also based on their network connectivity which might hint at central roles in resistance.

4. **Functional Annotation of Uncharacterized Proteins**: Using AI-assisted tools like AlphaFold for structural predictions provides a new dimension of insight. Additionally, sequence homology searches using tools like BLAST against comprehensive databases can identify potential functional analogs. For domain-based predictions, Pfam and InterProScan can provide insights into potential biological functions.

5. **Exploratory Analyses**: Consider incorporating unsupervised learning techniques like clustering or PCA for exploratory data analysis. These methods can reveal hidden patterns or groupings in the data that might not be immediately apparent with supervised approaches.

6. **Data Requirements**: In addition to the RNA-seq data, access to proteomics data or any phenotypic data associated with the samples could significantly enhance our analysis. This would allow us to correlate transcriptomic changes directly with protein-level or phenotype-level changes.

By combining these computational strategies with functional insights, we can better understand the underlying mechanisms of metronidazole resistance in Giardia intestinalis. I look forward to the Software Developer's input on how we can implement these strategies in a reproducible and automatable pipeline.

## Software Developer

Thank you, everyone, for your insightful contributions. As a Software Developer focusing on pipeline automation and reproducibility, I’d like to add the following points:

1. **Automated, Reproducible Workflow**: Given the complexity of our analysis, it's crucial that we build a unified, automated pipeline that integrates all stages from data preprocessing to functional interpretation. Using Snakemake or Nextflow can help us manage dependencies and ensure the pipeline is reproducible across different environments, including Windows.

2. **Version Control and Documentation**: We'll need to maintain rigorous version control using Git to track changes in our analysis scripts and maintain a clear history of our methodological choices. Comprehensive documentation using tools like Sphinx (for Python) or R Markdown will ensure that our workflow is transparent and reproducible by others.

3. **Integration of Bioinformatics Tools**: We should seamlessly integrate R/Bioconductor packages like DESeq2 or edgeR for differential expression analysis and Python tools for functional annotation. This may involve writing wrapper scripts to manage inputs/outputs and automate data flow between steps.

4. **Data Visualization**: To create publication-quality visualizations, libraries like ggplot2 in R or Matplotlib in Python can be utilized. Automating the generation of plots such as volcano plots, PCA, and heatmaps will ensure consistency and reproducibility in the visual output.

5. **Modular Design**: A modular pipeline design will allow us to update or replace individual components without disrupting the entire workflow. This could be particularly useful as new tools or methods become available.

6. **Performance Optimization**: As we deal with potentially large datasets, optimizing for performance is key. Utilizing parallel processing capabilities and efficient data handling can significantly reduce computation time.

These considerations will help us build a robust pipeline that not only facilitates the in-depth analysis required for this project but also ensures that our results are reproducible and ready for wider dissemination. I'm eager to hear how we can further refine these approaches as we continue our discussion.

## Bioinformatics Specialist

Thank you, Principal Investigator. I’m pleased with the direction we’re taking and would like to address the question regarding handling variability among sensitive strains:

1. **Handling Variability Among Sensitive Strains**: To address potential variability, we should include covariates that account for batch effects or any known differences in culture conditions among the sensitive strains. This could involve:

   - **Batch Effects**: If samples were processed in different batches, including batch as a covariate in the model can help mitigate this source of variability.
   - **Strain-Specific Behavior**: Including strain as a random effect or examining strain-specific differences in the baseline expression can provide insights. We can also explore principal component analysis (PCA) or surrogate variable analysis (SVA) to identify and adjust for unwanted variation.

2. **Data Quality and Preprocessing**: Ensuring high-quality data preprocessing will be critical. This includes verifying that all samples are well-normalized and that any low-quality samples are excluded. Additionally, exploring data transformations, such as variance stabilizing transformation (VST) in DESeq2, might enhance model performance.

By incorporating these considerations, our differential expression analysis can become more robust. I look forward to discussing further refinements and hearing more from the other team members.

## Software Developer

Thank you, Principal Investigator. I'd like to build on the computational strategies discussed and address the optimal structuring of our pipeline for performance and efficiency:

1. **Pipeline Structure for Performance Efficiency**:
   - **Modular Design**: Implementing a modular architecture allows us to isolate different steps of the analysis, making the pipeline easier to manage and update. Each module should handle a specific task, such as data preprocessing, differential expression analysis, or functional annotation.

   - **Concurrent Execution**: Utilizing tools like Snakemake or Nextflow, which support parallel execution, will enable us to run independent tasks concurrently, significantly reducing runtime. For instance, preprocessing and QC steps can run simultaneously while the main analysis waits for completion.

   - **Resource Allocation**: Tailoring resource allocation to the needs of each step can prevent underutilization or bottlenecks. For computationally heavy tasks like structural predictions, reserving more CPU and memory resources will be crucial.

2. **Efficient Data Handling**:
   - **Use of Intermediate Files**: To avoid redundant computation, intermediate results should be stored and reused wherever possible. This approach reduces duplication and speeds up reruns of the pipeline, especially during debugging or iterative testing.

   - **Data Caching**: Implementing caching mechanisms for frequently accessed data can further enhance performance. This is particularly useful for large datasets that are repeatedly accessed across different pipeline stages.

3. **Reproducibility and Portability**:
   - **Containerization**: Using Docker or Singularity to encapsulate the entire software environment ensures that the pipeline can be executed consistently across different systems without compatibility issues.

   - **Comprehensive Documentation**: Clear documentation of each module, including input/output specifications and dependencies, ensures that both current team members and future collaborators can understand and use the pipeline effectively.

By focusing on these strategies, we can build a pipeline that is not only efficient and scalable but also robust and easy to maintain. I look forward to further refining these ideas with input from the team as we continue to develop our analysis framework.

   **Decision**: We will implement parallel processing and ensure standardized input/output formats, utilizing profiling tools to optimize performance.

4. **Pipeline Architecture and Efficiency**: The Software Developer proposed a modular, concurrent execution pipeline structure, emphasizing containerization and documentation for reproducibility and performance.

   **Decision**: We will structure our pipeline using Snakemake or Nextflow, with a focus on modularity, concurrent execution, and containerization to ensure efficiency and reproducibility.

**Follow-Up Questions:**

- To the Bioinformatics Specialist: Can you provide more details on how SVA will be implemented and interpreted in our context? Are there specific considerations or pitfalls we should be aware of?

- To the Parasitology Expert: Are there specific known pathways or genes in Giardia that we should prioritize in our initial analysis based on existing knowledge of metronidazole resistance?

- To the Computational Biologist: Could you elaborate on any specific tool integration challenges you foresee and how we could proactively address them?

- To the Software Developer: What are the potential risks of using containerization, and how can we ensure that our pipeline remains flexible to future updates or changes in the computational environment?

Your insights will be vital as we continue refining our plan. I encourage each of you to consider these questions as we prepare for the final round of our discussion, where we will finalize our strategy for moving forward. Thank you for your continued dedication to this project.

## Bioinformatics Specialist

Thank you, Principal Investigator. I'll address the question about implementing and interpreting SVA in our analysis:

1. **Implementation of SVA**: Surrogate Variable Analysis (SVA) is a powerful method to identify and adjust for hidden sources of variability in high-throughput data, such as batch effects or other unmeasured confounders.

   - **Implementation Steps**: We would first run SVA on our normalized count data to estimate the surrogate variables (SVs) that capture this unwanted variation. These SVs are then included as covariates in our differential expression model with DESeq2 or edgeR.

   - **Software Tools**: The `sva` package in R is well-suited for this task, and it integrates smoothly with DESeq2, allowing us to incorporate SVs directly into our design formula.

2. **Interpretation and Considerations**:
   - **Role of SVs**: SVs help separate the biological signal from technical noise. By including them in our model, we can improve the accuracy of our differential expression results.
   
   - **Potential Pitfalls**: One consideration is ensuring that SVs do not inadvertently adjust for biological variability of interest. This requires careful interpretation, where we validate that the SVs are indeed capturing noise rather than meaningful biological variation.

3. **Quality Control**: Before and after applying SVA, using diagnostic plots (such as PCA plots of the expression data) can help verify that known batch effects have been mitigated without over-adjusting.

By thoughtfully implementing SVA, we can enhance the rigor of our analysis. I look forward to the contributions from the rest of the team as we finalize our strategy.

## Parasitology Expert

Thank you, Principal Investigator. I'll address the prioritization of pathways and genes known to be involved in metronidazole resistance in Giardia:

1. **Prioritizing Known Pathways**:
   - **Nitroreductase Enzymes**: These enzymes are directly involved in the activation of metronidazole. Resistance has been linked to changes in the expression or activity of nitroreductase genes in Giardia. We should prioritize their expression levels and potential mutations.

   - **Oxidative Stress Response**: Metronidazole's mechanism involves the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Genes involved in oxidative stress response pathways, such as those encoding for antioxidant enzymes like superoxide dismutase, should be prioritized.

   - **DNA Repair Mechanisms**: Since metronidazole causes DNA damage, genes involved in DNA repair pathways, particularly those related to base excision repair, could hold key insights into resistance.

2. **Potential Unknown Players**:
   - **Transporter Proteins**: Changes in membrane transport proteins might affect drug uptake or efflux, contributing to resistance. Identifying differentially expressed transporters could provide new resistance mechanisms.

   - **Uncharacterized Genes**: Beyond known pathways, putative or uncharacterized genes showing significant expression changes in the resistant line should not be overlooked as they may represent novel resistance factors.

3. **Cross-Referencing**: Use databases and recent literature to cross-reference our findings, ensuring that any new candidates align with known biological processes linked to resistance.

These priorities will guide our initial focus and help contextualize our results within the broader framework of Giardia biology. I’m eager to hear how the Computational Biologist will integrate these biological insights into our computational framework.

## Computational Biologist

Thank you, Principal Investigator. I will address the potential tool integration challenges and how we might address them effectively:

1. **Tool Integration Challenges**:
   - **Data Formats and Compatibility**: One of the primary challenges is ensuring compatibility between different software tools, which often require specific input formats. For instance, the output from DESeq2 or edgeR needs to be compatible with downstream functional analysis tools like GSEA or pathway enrichment software.

   - **Interfacing Between R and Python**: Our pipeline may need to integrate R-based and Python-based tools, which can pose challenges in terms of data exchange and workflow management.

2. **Mitigation Strategies**:
   - **Standardization of Data Formats**: Developing a set of standardized file formats for intermediate and final outputs will reduce compatibility issues. Using commonly accepted formats like CSV, TSV, or FASTA for data exchange can facilitate smoother transitions between steps.

   - **Interoperability Solutions**: Leveraging tools like RPy2 (for integrating R and Python) or using Python libraries like rpy2 to call R functions directly from Python can help integrate different tools within a single script or pipeline.

   - **Data Wrappers and Custom Scripts**: Writing custom scripts or wrappers to convert data formats as needed between tools will ensure seamless data flow. This might include converting DESeq2 results into formats accepted by pathway analysis tools.

3. **Testing and Validation**: Thoroughly testing each component of the pipeline in isolation and then as part of the integrated workflow will help identify and rectify any issues early on.

By anticipating these challenges and proactively developing solutions, we can ensure our pipeline is robust and flexible enough to accommodate the various tools we plan to use. I look forward to hearing the Software Developer's thoughts on ensuring flexibility and adaptability in our pipeline, particularly with containerization.

Thank you, Principal Investigator. I'll address the potential risks of using containerization and maintaining flexibility for future updates in our pipeline:

1. **Potential Risks of Containerization**:
   - **Overhead and Complexity**: While containerization simplifies dependency management, it can introduce overhead in terms of learning curve and complexity, especially for team members unfamiliar with Docker or Singularity.
   
   - **Version Drift**: Containers can sometimes lead to version drift if not properly maintained, where outdated versions of tools and dependencies are used because the container was not updated.

2. **Ensuring Flexibility and Adaptability**:
   - **Regular Updates and Maintenance**: To avoid version drift, it's essential to regularly update our container images and use automated tools (e.g., CI/CD pipelines) to rebuild and test containers frequently.
   
   - **Modular Container Design**: Using a microservice approach where each major step of the pipeline is containerized separately can increase flexibility. This allows individual components to be updated independently as new tools or versions become available.

   - **Documentation and Training**: Comprehensive documentation and training materials for using and updating containers will mitigate the learning curve and ensure all team members can effectively work within this framework.

3. **Monitoring and Logging**: Implement logging and monitoring within containers to quickly identify and troubleshoot any issues that arise during execution, contributing to more efficient updates and debugging.

By focusing on these strategies, we can ensure that our containerized pipeline remains a flexible, efficient, and powerful tool for our analysis efforts. I look forward to implementing these solutions and collaborating further with the team as we finalize our comprehensive analysis plan.

## User

Principal Investigator, please summarize the meeting in detail for future discussions, provide a specific recommendation regarding the agenda, and answer the agenda questions (if any) based on the discussion while strictly adhering to the agenda rules (if any).

As a reminder, here is the agenda for the meeting:




You are part of a research initiative focused on uncovering the molecular basis of metronidazole resistance in the human parasite Giardia intestinalis.

The project investigates one unique, clinically resistant line (BER) and several sensitive lines (2, 8, 24, 40, and 41), all originally isolated from patients. 
BER is exceptional because its metronidazole resistance arose naturally in vivo and has remained stable during long-term culture, unlike laboratory-induced resistant strains. 
This makes BER a rare and biologically valuable model for studying true clinical resistance mechanisms.

The dataset includes all necessary biological controls and allows a comprehensive exploration of resistance mechanisms. 
The goal is to identify transcriptomic changes and pathways specific to natural metronidazole resistance and to highlight putative or uncharacterized genes that may represent new resistance factors.

Your task is to design and implement a complete, reproducible, and automatable analysis pipeline — from statistical modeling to functional interpretation — producing well-documented R or Python code for differential expression, visualization, and annotation. 
You may also apply modern computational tools (e.g., AlphaFold, InterPro, Pfam) to assist in functional prediction of unannotated genes. 
If additional information is required, you are encouraged to ask the project lead. Collaboration and clear reasoning are preferred.



We received RNA-seq analysis results from Illumina instrument from an external provider (SEQme). Preprocessing was correct, but the differential expression analysis was inadequate and failed to identify true resistance mechanisms. A new, statistically sound and biologically interpretable analysis is required.

Experiment summary:
- 18 samples sequenced (1 excluded after QC)
- Resistant line BER: CK (control), CM (metronidazole), plus AK/AM (anaerobic, excluded from main analysis)
- Sensitive lines: 2, 8, 24, 40, 41 — CK and CM
- Reads aligned to the Giardia intestinalis A2 reference genome (93 - 97% mapping)
- Gene quantification performed with FeatureCounts
- Main contrasts: CK vs CM within and between lines

Data location:
All input data are in the experimental_data/ folder (count matrices, metadata, genome annotation, and QC reports). 
Incorrect SEQme analyses are included for reference only (DO NOT USE). 
Raw FASTQ/BAM files are stored externally.

Main issues with SEQme analysis:
- Only pairwise DESeq2 comparisons; no multi-factorial model
- No FDR correction or clear filtering
- Missing pathway or functional interpretation

Required re-analysis:
Re-analyze RNA-seq data using an integrative, multi-layer pipeline combining statistical rigor and biological interpretation.

1. Differential expression
- Multi-factorial model: phenotype (resistant vs sensitive), treatment (control vs metronidazole), and interaction
- Identify constitutive resistance (BER vs sensitive baseline)
- Separate drug-induced vs resistance-specific effects
- Control for variability among sensitive strains
- Apply FDR-adjusted thresholds and meaningful log2FC cutoffs

2. Functional analysis
- Perform enrichment and pathway analysis (GO, KEGG, Reactome)
- Rank candidate resistance genes for validation
- Annotate putative or uncharacterized genes linked to resistance

3. Integrative and exploratory analysis
- Use co-expression or network clustering to find gene modules
- Apply AI-assisted prediction for unknown gene functions (e.g., sequence, domain, or structure-based)

Deliverables:
Provide reproducible R/Python code, publication-quality visualizations (volcano plots, PCA, heatmaps, network maps), and propose new hypotheses explaining metronidazole resistance in Giardia intestinalis.
 
Design a transcriptomic analysis plan to identify genes specifically linked to metronidazole resistance in the BER line of Giardia intestinalis. Clearly distinguish resistance-specific effects from general drug responses and baseline strain differences. Propose a statistical model (e.g. with interaction terms) to detect these effects. Prioritize candidate resistance genes for validation and link them to biological functions using functional annotation tools. Include an approach for analyzing uncharacterized (putative) proteins.

As a reminder, here are the agenda questions that must be answered:

1. What is the most effective approach to identify genes linked to metronidazole resistance in *Giardia intestinalis*?

2. How can resistance-specific expression be separated from general drug response and baseline differences between strains?

3. Is a simple comparison sufficient, or is a complex statistical model needed? Why?

4. How should candidate genes be functionally annotated and connected to biological pathways?

5. What strategy can identify and characterize putative (unannotated) proteins among the candidate genes?

6. Are any additional files, metadata, or annotations needed to perform the analysis effectively?

Your summary should take the following form.
